once upon a time it befell ailill and medb that when their royal bed had been prepared for them in rth crachain in connacht they spoke together as they lay on their pillow in truth woman said ailill she is a welloff woman who is the wife of a nobleman she is indeed said the woman why do you think so i think so said ailill because you are better off today than when i married you i was welloff before marrying you said medb it was wealth that we had not heard of and did not know of said ailill but you were a woman of property and foes from lands next to you were carrying off spoils and booty from you not so was i said medb but my father was in the highkingship of ireland namely eochu feidlech mac find meic findomain meic findeoin meic findguill meic rotha meic rigeoin meic blathachta meic beothechta meic enna agnig meic engusa turbig he had six daughters: derbriu ethne and ele clothru mugain and medb i was the noblest and worthiest of them i was the most generous of them in bounty and the bestowal of gifts i was best of them in battle and fight and combat i had fifteen hundred royal mercenaries of the sons of strangers exiled from their own land and as many of the sons of native freemen within the province and there were ten men for each mercenary of these and nine men for every mercenary and eight men for every mercenary and seven for every mercenary and six for every mercenary and five for every mercenary and four for every mercenary and three for every mercenary and two for every mercenary and one mercenary for every mercenary i had these as my standing household said medb and for that reason my father gave me one of the  p  line provinces of ireland namely the province of crachu whence i am called medb chrachna messengers came from find mac rosa raid the king of leinster to sue for me and from cairbre nia fer mac rosa the king of tara and they came from conchobor mac fachtna the king of ulster and they came from eochu bec but i consented not for i demanded a strange bride gift such as no woman before me had asked of a man of the men of ireland to wit a husband without meanness without jealousy without fear if my husband should be mean it would not be fitting for us to be together for i am generous in largesse and the bestowal of gifts and it would be a reproach for my husband that i should be better than he in generosity but it would be no reproach if we were equally generous provided that both of us were generous if my husband were timorous neither would it be fitting for us to be together for singlehanded i am victorious in battles and contests and combats and it would be a reproach to my husband that his wife should be more courageous than he but it is no reproach if they are equally courageous provided that both are courageous if the man with whom i should be were jealous neither would it be fitting for i was never without one lover quickly succeeding another lit without a man in the shadow of another  now such a husband have i got even you ailill mac rosa raid of leinster you are not niggardly you are not jealous you are not inactive i gave you a contract and a brideprice as befits a woman namely the raiment of twelve men a chariot worth thrice seven cumala the breadth of your face in red gold the weight of your left arm in white bronze whoever brings shame and annoyance and confusion on you you have no claim for compensation of for honourprice for it except what claim i have said medb for you are a man dependent on a womans marriageportion not so was i said ailill but i had two brothers one of them reigning over tara the other over leinster namely find over leinster and cairbre over tara i left the rule to them because of their seniority but they were no better in bounty and the bestowal of gifts than i and i heard of no province in ireland dependent on a woman except this province alone so i came and assumed the kingship here in virtue of my mothers rights for mta muirisc the daughter of mga was my mother and what better queen could i have than you for you are the daughter of the highking of ireland nevertheless said medb my property is greater than yours i marvel at that said ailill p  line for there is none who has greater possessions and riches and wealth than i and i know that there is not there were brought to them what was least valuable among their possessions that they might know which of them had more goods and riches and wealth there were brought to them their wooden cups and their vats and their iron vessels their cans their washingbasins and their tubs there were brought to them their rings and their bracelets and their thumbrings their treasures of gold and their garments as well purple as blue and black and green yellow and varicoloured and grey dun and chequered and striped their great flocks of sheep were brought from fields and lawns and open plains they were counted and reckoned and it was recognised that they were equal of the same size and of the same number but among medbs sheep there was a splendid ram which was the equivalent of a cumalin value and among ailills sheep was a ram corresponding to him from grazing lands and paddocks were brought their horses and steeds in medbs horseherd there was a splendid horse which might be valued at a cumal ailill had a horse to match him then their great herds of swine were brought from woods and sloping glens and solitary places they were counted and reckoned and recognised medb had a special boar and ailill had another then their herds of cows their cattle and their droves were brought to them from the woods and waste places of the province they were counted and reckoned and recognised and they were of equal size and equal number but among ailills cows there was a special bull he had been a calf of one of medbs cows and his name was findbennach but he deemed it unworthy of him to be counted as a womans property so he went and took his place among the kings cows it was to medb as if she owned not a penny of possessions since she had not a bull as great as that among her kine then mac roth the herald was summoned to medb and she asked him to find out where in any province of the provinces of ireland there might be a bull such as he i know indeed said mac roth where there is a bull even better and more excellent than he in the province of ulster in the cantred of cailnge in the house of dire mac fiachna donn cailnge is his name go you there mac roth and ask of dire for me a years loan of donn cailnge at the years end he will get the fee for the bulls loan namely fifty heifers and donn cailnge himself returned and take another offer with you mac roth: if the people of that land and country object to giving that precious possession donn cailnge let dire himself come with his bull  p  line and he shall have the extent of his own lands in the level plain of mag a and a chariot worth thrice seven cumala and he shall have my own intimate friendship thereupon the messengers proceeded to the house of dire mac fiachna the number of mac roths embassy was nine messengers then mac roth was welcomed in the house of dire that was but right for mac roth was the chief herald of all dire asked mac roth what was the cause of his journey and why he had come the herald told why he had come and related the contention between medb and ailill and it is to ask for a loan of the donn cailnge to match the findbennach that i have come said he and you shall get the fee for his loan namely fifty heifers and the return of donn cailnge himself and there is somewhat besides: come yourself with your bull and you shall get an area equal to your own lands in the level plain of mag a and a chariot worth thrice seven cumala and medbs intimate friendship to boot dire was well pleased with that and in his pleasure he shook himself so that the seams of the flockbeds beneath him burst asunder and he said: by the truth of my conscience even it the ulstermen object this precious possession donn cailnge will now be taken to ailill and medb in the land of connacht mac roth was pleased to hear what mac fiachna said  then they were attended to and straw and fresh rushes were strewn underfoot for them the choicest food was served to them and a drinking feast provided until they were merry and a conversation took place between two of the messengers in sooth said one messenger generous is the man in whose house we are generous indeed said the other is there among the ulstermen any who is more generous than he said the first messenger there is indeed said the second more generous is conchobor whose vassal dire is for though all ulstermen should rally round conchobor it were no shame for them a great act of generosity it is indeed for dire to have given to us nine messengers that which it would have been the work of the four great provinces of ireland to carry of from the land of ulster namely donn cailnge then a third messenger joined their conversation and what are ye saying he asked yon messenger says that the man in whose house we are is a generous man he is generous indeed says another is there any among the ulsterman who is more generous then he asks the first messenger there is indeed says the second conchobor whose vassal dire is is more generous and if all ulstermen adhered to him it were indeed no shame for them it was  p  line generous of dire to give to us nine messengers what only the four great provinces of ireland could carry off from the land of ulster i should like to see a gush of blood and gore from the mouth from which that talk comes for if the bull were not given willingly he would be given perforce then dire mac fiachnas butler came into the house with a man carrying liquor and another carrying meat and he heard what the messengers said he flew into a passion and laid down the meat and d rink for them and he did not invite them to consume it neither did he tell them not to consume it thereafter he went to the house where dire mac fiachna was and said: was it you who gave that excellent treasure the donn cailnge to the messengers it was i indeed said dire where he was given may there be no proper rule for what they say is true that if you do not give him of your own free will you will give him by force by reason of the armies of ailill and medb and the guidance of fergus mac rig i swear by the gods whom i worship unless they take him thus by force they shall not take him by fair meansthey spend the night thus until morning early on the morrow the messengers arose and went into the house where dire was guide us noble sir to the spot where donn cailnge is not so indeed said dire but if it were my custom to deal treacherously with messengers or travellers of voyagers not one of you should escape alive what is this said mac roth there is great cause for it said dire ye said that if i did not give the bull willingly then i should give him under compulsion by reason of the army of ailill and medb and the sure guidance of fergus nay said mac roth whatever messengers might say as a result of indulging in your meat and drink it should not be heeded or noticed nor accounted as a reproach to ailill and medb yet i shall not give my bull mac roth on this occasion  thus the messengers went on their way back and reached rth crachan in connacht medb asked tidings of them mac roth told her that they had not brought back his bull from dire what was the cause of that asked medb mac roth told her the reason for it there is no necessity to smooth the knots mac roth for it was certain  lit it was known  said medb that he would not be given freely if he were not given by force and he shall so be given p  line  messengers went from medb to the maines to bid them come to crachu the seven maines with their seven divisions of three thousand namely maine mithremail maine aithremail maine condagaib uile maine mingor maine mrgor and maine conda m epert other messengers went to the sons of mgu namely cet mac mgach anlan mac mgach mac corb mac mgach baiscell mac mgach en mac mgach dche mac mgach and scannal mac mgach these arrived in number three thousand armed men other messengers went from them to cormac cond longas mac conchobuir and to fergus mac rig and they too came in number three thousand  the first band of all had shorn heads of hair green cloaks about them with silver brooches in them next to their skin they wore shirts of gold thread with red insertions of red gold they carried swords with white grips and handles of silver is that cormac yonder they all asked it is not indeed said medb  the second band had newly shorn heads of hair they wore grey cloaks and pure white shirts next to their skins they carried swords with round guards of gold and silver handles is that cormac yonder they all asked it is not he indeed said medb  the last band had flowing hair fairyellow golden streaming manes they wore purple embroidered cloaks with golden inset brooches over their breasts they had smooth long silken shirts reaching to their insteps all together they would lift their feet and set them down again is that cormac yonder they all asked it is he indeed said medb  that night they pitched their camp and stronghold and there was a dense mass of smoke and fire from their campfires between the four fords of a th moga th mbercna th slissen and th coltna and they stayed for a full fortnight in rth crachan of connacht drinking and feasting and merrymaking so that presently their journey and hosting should be the lighter for them and then medb bade her charioteer harness her horses for her that she might go to speak with her druid to seek foreknowledge and prophecy from him  when medb came to where her druid was she asked foreknowledge and prophecy of him there are many who part here today from comrades and friends said medb from land and territory from father and mother and if not all return safe and sound it is on me their grumbles and their curses will fall yet none goes forth and none stays here who is any dearer to us than we ourselves and  p  line find out for us whether we shall come back or not and the druid said: whoever comes or comes not back you yourself will come the driver turned the chariot and medb came back she saw something that she deemed wonderful namely a women coming towards her by the shaft of the chariot the girl was weaving a fringe holding a weavers beam of white bronze in her right hand with seven strips of red gold on its points she wore a spotted greenspeckled cloak with a round heavyheaded brooch in the cloak above her breast she had a crimson richblooded  fairfaced st  countenance a bright laughing eye thin red lips she had shining pearly teeth you would have thought they were showers of fair pearls which were displayed in her head like new partaing were her lips the sweet sound of her voice and speech was as melodious as the strings of harps plucked by the hands of masters as white as snow falling in one night was the lustre of her skin and body shining through her garments she had long and very white feet with pink even round and sharp nails she had long fairyellow golden hair three tresses of her hair wound round her head another tress falling behind which touched the calves of her legs medb gazed at her and what are you doing here now girl said medb i am promoting your interest and your prosperity gathering and mustering the four great provinces of ireland with you to go into ulster for tin b cailnge why do you do that for me said medb i have good reason to do so i am a bondmaid of your people who of my people are you said medb that is not hard to tell i am feidelm the prophetess from sd chrachna well then feidelm prophetess how do you see our army i see red on them i see crimson  conchobor is suffering in his debility in emain said medb my messengers have gone to him there is nothing we fear from the ulstermen but tell the truth feidelm o feidelm prophetess how do you see our army i see red on them i see crimson  cuscraid mend macha mac conchobuir is in inis cuscraid in his debility my messengers have gone to him there is nothing we fear from the ulstermen but speak truth feidelm o feidelm prophetess how do you see our army i see red upon them i see crimson  eogan mac durthacht is at rth airthir in his debility my messengers have gone to him there is nothing we fear from the ulstermen but speak truth to us feidelm o feidelm prophetess how do you see our army i see red on them i see crimson  p  line  celtchair mac cuthechair is in his fortress in his debility my messengers have reached him there is nothing we fear from the ulstermen but speak truth feidelm o feidelm prophetess how do you see our army i see red on them i see crimson  i care not for your reasoning for when the men of ireland gather in one place among them will be strife and battle and broils and affrays in dispute as to who shall lead the van or bring up the rear or first cross ford or river or first kill swine or cow or stag or game but speak truth to us feidelm o feidelm prophetess how do you see our army i see red on them i see crimson  and feidelm began to prophesy and foretell c chulainn to the men of ireland and she chanted a lay:  feidelm   i see a fair man who will perform weaponfeats with many a wound in his fair flesh the heros light is on his brow his forehead is the meetingplace of many virtues   seven gems of a hero are in his eyes his spear heads are unsheathed he wears a red mantle with clasps  his face is the fairest he amazes womenfolk a young lad of handsome countenance yet in battle he shows a dragons form   like is his prowess to that of c chulainn of muirtheimne i know not who is the c chulainn from murtheimne but this i know that this army will be bloodstained from him   four sword lets of wonderful feats he has in each hand he will manage to ply them on the host each weapon has its own special use   when he carries his ga bulga as well as his sword and spear this man wrapped in a red mantle sets his foot on every battlefield   his two spears across the wheelrim of his battle chariot high above valour  is the distorted one so he has hitherto appeared to me but i am sure that he would change his appearance  p  line   he has moved forward to the battle if he is not warded off there will be destruction it is he who seeks you in combat c chulainn mac sualtaim   he will lay low your entire army and he will slaughter you in dense crowds ye shall leave with him all your heads the prophetess feidelm conceals it not   blood will flow from heroes bodies long will it be remembered mens bodies will be hacked women will lament through the hound of the smith that i see  thus far the prophecy and augury and the prelude to the tale the basis of its invention and composition and the pillowtalk held by ailill and medb in crachu this is the route of the tin and the beginning of the hosting together with the names of the roads on which the men of the four great provinces of ireland travelled into the land of ulster:  to mag cruinn by way of tuaim mna by turloch tera crch by cl slinne by dubfid by badbna by coltan across the river shannon by gline gabur by mag trega by northern tethba by southern tethba by cil by ochain by uata northwards by tiarthechta eastwards by ord by

ailill mac rosas tent was pitched for him the tent of fergus mac rich was on his right hand cormac cond longas mac conchobuir was beside fergus th mac etgath  p  line was next then fiachu mac fir aba then goibnend mac lurgnig such was the placing of ailills tent on his right during that hosting and thus were the thirty hundred men of ulster at his right hand so that the confidential talk and discourse and the choicest portions of food and drink might be nearer to them medb chrachan was on ailills left with findabair beside her then came flidais fholtchan the wife of ailill find who had slept with fergus on tin b cailnge and it was she who every seventh night on that hosting quenched with milk the thirst of all the men of ireland king and queen and prince poet and learner medb was the last of the hosts that day for she had been seeking foreknowledge and prophecy and tidings that she might learn who was loath and who was eager to go on the expedition medb did not permit her chariot to be let down or her horses to be unyoked until she had made a circuit of the encampment then medbs horses were unyoked and her chariots were let down and she sat beside ailill mac mgach and ailill asked medb to find out who was eager and who reluctant or loath to go on the hosting it is useless for any to set out on it except for the one band namely the division of the gailioin said medb what good service do they do that they are praised above all others said ailill there is reason to praise them said medb when the others began to pitch their camp these had already finished making their bothies and open tents when the others had finished their bothies and open tents these had finished preparing food and drink when the others had finished preparing food and drink these had finished eating their meal when the others had finished their meal these were asleep even as their slaves and servants surpassed the slaves and servants of the men of ireland so their warriors and champions will surpass those of the men of ireland on this occasion on the hosting all the better do we deem that said ailill for it is with us they march and it is for us they fight it is not with us they will go nor for us they will fight let them stay at home then said ailill they shall not stay said medb what shall they do then said findabair if they do not go forth nor yet stay at home death and destruction and slaughter i desire for them said medb woe betide him who speaks thus said ailill because of their having pitched their tents and set up their stronghold quickly and promptly by the truth of my conscience said fergus only he who inflicts death on me shall  p  line inflict death on those men not to me should you say that fergus said medb for my army is numerous enough to slay and kill you with the thirty hundred leinstermen surrounding you for i have the seven maines with their seven divisions of thirty hundred and the sons of mga with their division and ailill with his division and i myself have my household guard our numbers are sufficient to slay and kill you with the division of the leinstermen around you it is not fitting to speak thus to me said fergus for i have here the seven underkings of the munstermen with their seven divisions here too is a division of the best among the noble warriors of ulster here are the finest of the noble warriors of the men of ireland the division of the gailioin i myself am bond and surety and guarantee for them since they came from their own lands and me shall they uphold in this day of battle furthermore said fergus those men shall not be gap: text untranslatedextent:  words  i shall disperse yon division of the gailioin amongst the men of ireland so that not five of them shall be together in one place i care not said medb in what way they are provided only that they are not in the close battle array in which they now are then fergus dispersed that division among the men of ireland so that no five men of them were together in one spot thereafter the hosts set out upon their march it was difficult for them to attend to that mighty army which set forth on that journey with the many tribes and the many families and the many thousands whom they brought with them that they might see each other and know each other and that each might be with his familiars and his friends and his kin on the hosting they said too in what manner it was fitting to go on that hosting they said that they should go thus: with every troop around their king with every band around their leader every group around their chief and every king and royal heir of the men of ireland on his own mound apart they discussed too who ought to guide them between the two provinces and they said that it should be fergus because the hosting was a hostile hosting for him for he had been seven years in the kingship of ulster and when the sons of usnech had been slain in despite of his guarantee and surety he had come from there and he has been seventeen years in exile and in enmity away from ulster therefore it would be fitting that he should go before all to guide them then fergus went before all to guide them but a feeling of affection for the ulsterman seized him and he led the troops astray to the north and to the south and messengers went from him with warnings to the ulstermen  p  line and he began to delay and hold back the army medb perceived this and she reproached him and chanted the lay: medb  o fergus what do we say of this what manner of path is this which we go past every tribe we wander north and south  fergus  o medb why are you perturbed this is not anything which resembles treachery o woman the land i traverse belongs to the men of ulster  medb  ailill the splendid with his army fears that you will betray him  fears  him following lu st   hitherto you have not given your mind to leading us on the right path fergus  not to the disadvantage of the host did i go on each wandering road in turn but to try and avoid thereafter c chulainn mac sualtaim  medb  it is wrong of you to betray our host o fergus mac rosa raid for much wealth did you get here in your exile o fergus  i shall not be in front of the army any longer said fergus but seek some one else to lead them yet fergus took his position in the van of the army  the four great provinces of ireland were on cil silinne that night a sharp premonition of the arrival of c chula inn came to fergus and he told the men of ireland to be on their guard for there would come upon them he who was the slashing lion and the doom of enemies and the foe of armies the supporting leader and the slaughtering of a great host the hand bestowing gifts and the flaming torch to wit c chulainn the son of sualtaim and fergus was thus prophesying the coming of c chulainn and he made the lay and medb answered him:  fergus  it is well for you to keep watch and ward with many weapons and many warriors he whom we fear will come the great and valiant one form muirtheimne  p  line  medb  kindly is that of youa counsel of battleo valiant mac rig men and arms i have here on the spot to answer c chulainn  fergus  men and arms are expended in the fray o medb from mag a against the rider of liath macha every night and every day  medb  i have here in reserve warriors to fight and to plunder thirty hundred hostage chiefs the warriors of the gailioin  warriors from fair crachu heroes from clear robed lachair four provinces of fair gaelsall these will defend me from that one man  fergus  he who has troops in bairrche and banna will draw blood across the shafts of spears into the mire and sand he will cast that division of the gailioin  as swift as the swallow and as speedy as the harsh windthus is my fair dear c in mutual slaughter above the breath of his foes  medb  o fergus famed in song let this message go from you to c chulainn that it were prudent for him to be silent for he shall be harshly checked in crachu  fergus  valiantly will men be despoiled in the land of badbs daughter the hound of the smithwith shedding of gorewill overthrow companies of goodly heroes  after that lay: the army of the four great provinces of ireland came eastwards over min coltna that day and there met them eight score deer the army spread out and surrounded them and killed them so that none escaped yet though the division of the gailioin were dispersed only five deer fell to the men of ireland the one division of the gailioin carried of the rest of the eight score deer it was on the same day that c chulainn mac sualtaim and sualtach sdech his father arrived and their horses grazed around the pillarstone at ard cuillenn sualtaims steeds cropped the grass down to the soil north of the pillarstone c chulainns steeds  p  line cropped the grass down to the soil and the bedrock to the south of the pillarstone well father sualtaim said c chulainn i have a premonition that the army is at hand so go for me with warnings to the ulstermen that they stay not on the open plains but go to the woods and waste places and deep valleys of the province to evade the men of ireland and you my fosterling what will you do i must go southwards to tara to keep a tryst with the handmaiden of feidilmid nochruthach with my own surety until morning woe to him who goes thus said sualtaim and leaves the ulstermen to be trampled underfoot by their enemies and by outlanders for the sake of going to a tryst with any women i must go however for unless i do mens contracts will be falsified and womens words be verified sualtaim went with warnings to the ulstermen c chulainn went into the wood and cut a prime oak sapling whole and entire with one stroke and standing on one leg and using but one hand and one eye he twisted it into a ring and put an ogam inscription on the peg of the ring and put the ring around the narrow part of the standingstone at ard cuillenn he forced the ring down until it reached the thick part of the stone after that c chulainn went to his tryst  as for the men of ireland they came to the pillarstone at ard cuillenn and began to survey the unknown province of ulster now two men of medbs household were always in the van at every encampment and hosting at every ford and every river and every pass and this they did so that no stain might come to the princes garments in the crowd or crush of host or army these were the two sons of nera mac nuatair meic tacin the two sons of the steward of crachu err and innell were their names and frech and fochnam the names of their charioteers  the nobles of ireland came to the pillar stone and began to survey the grazing which the horses had made around the stone and to gaze at the barbaric ring which the royal hero had left around the stone and ailill took the ring in his hand and gave it to fergus and fergus read out the ogam inscription that was in the peg of the ring and told the men of ireland what the inscription meant  and as he began to tell them he made the lay:  fergus   this is a ring what is its meaning for us what is its secret message and how many put it here was it one man oft many  p  line   if ye go past it tonight and do not stay in camp beside it the hound who mangles all flesh will come upon you shame to you if ye flout it   if ye go on your way from it it brings ruin on the host find out o druids why the ring was made   it was the swift cutting of a hero a hero cast it it is a snare for enemies one manthe sustainer of lords a man of battle cast it there with one hand   it gave a pledge  with the harsh rage of the smiths hound from the crebrad it is a champions bond not the bond of a madman that is the inscription on the ring   its object is to cause anxiety to the four provinces of irelandand many combats that is all i know of the reason why the ring was made  after that lay: fergus said: i swear to you that if ye flout that ring and the royal hero who it and do not spend a night here in encampment until one of you make a similar ring standing on one foot and using one eye and one hand as he did even though that hero be hidden underground or in a locked house he will slay and wound you before the hour of rising on the morrow if ye flout it it is not that indeed that we would wish said medb that anyone should wound us or shed our blood after we have come to this unknown province the province of ulster more pleasing to us that we should wound another and spill his blood we shall not set this ring at naught said ailill and we shall not flout the royal hero who wrought it but we shall take shelter in this great wood in the south until morning let our encampment be made there then the hosts advanced and with their swords they hewed down the wood to make a path for their chariots so that slechta is still the name of that spot where is partraige beca southwest of cenannas na rg near cil sibrilli  heavy snow fell on them that night so deep it was that it reached to the shoulders of men to the flanks of horses and to the shafts of chariots so that the provinces of ireland were all one level plain with the snow but not tents or bothies or pavilions were set up that night no preparation of food or drink was made no meal or repast was consumed none of the men of ireland knew  p  line whether it was friend or foe who was next to him until the bright hour of sunrise on the morrow it is certain that the men of ireland had never experienced a night in encampment which held more discomfort and hardship for them than that night at cil sibrilli the four great provinces of ireland came forth early on the morrow with the rising of the sun across the glistening snow and they went forward from that district to another as for c chulainn however he did not rise early until he ate a repast and meal and washed and bathed on that day he told his charioteer to harness the horses and yoke his chariot the charioteer harnessed the horses and yoked the chariot and c chulainn went into his chariot and they followed the track of the army they found the trail of the men of ireland going past them from one district to another alas my friend leg said c chulainn would that we had not gone to our tryst with a woman last night the least that one who is guarding a border can do is to give a warning cry or shout or alarm or tell who goes the road we failed to announce it the men of ireland have gone past us into ulster i foretold for you c chulainn said leg that if you went to your tryst such a disgrace would come upon you go leg i pray you on the track of the army and make an estimate of them and find out for us in what number the men of ireland went past us leg came to the track of the host and came in front of the track and to one side of it and went to the rear of it you are confused in your reckoning my friend leg said c chulainn i am indeed said leg come into the chariot and i shall make an estimate of them the charioteer came into the chariot c chulainn went on the track of the host and made an estimate of their numbers and came to one side and went to the rear you are confused in your reckoning little c said leg i am not said c chulainn for i know in what number the hosts went past us namely eighteen divisions but the eighteenth division was dispersed among the men of irelandnow c chulainn possessed many and various gifts: the gift of beauty the gift of form the gift of build the gift of swimming the gift of horsemanship the gift of playing fidchell the gift of playing brandub the gift of battle the gift of fighting the gift of conflict the gift of sight the gift of speech the gift of counsel the gift of fowling the gift of laying waste  the gift of plundering in a strange border  good my friend leg harness the chariot for us and ply the goad for us on the horses drive on the chariot and turn your lefthand board to the hosts to see can we overtake them in the van or in the  p  line rear or in the middle for i shall not live if a friend or foe among the men of ireland fall not by my hand tonight then the charioteer plied the goad on the horses he turned his left board to the hosts and came to taurloch caille mre north of cnogba na rg which is called th ngabla then c chulainn went into the wood and descended from his chariot and cut a forked pole of four prongs whole and entire with one stroke he pointed it and charred it and put an ogam inscription on its side and cast it out of the back of his chariot from the tip of one hand so that two thirds of it went into the ground and but one third of it was above ground then it was that the two lads mentioned the two sons of nera mac nuatair meic tacin came upon him engaged in that task and they vied with one another as to which of them would first wound him and first behead him c chulainn attacked them and cut off their four heads from them and from their charioteer and impaled a head of each man of them on a prong of the pole and c chulainn sent the horses of that band back by the same road to meet the men of ireland with their reins lying loose and the headless trunks red with gore and the bodies of the warriors dripping blood down on to the framework of the chariots for he did not deem it honourable or seemly to take the horses or garments or arms from the bodies of those he killed then the hosts saw the horses of the band who had gone in advance of them and the headless bodies and the corpses of the warriors dripping blood down on the framework of the chariots the van of the army waited for the rear and all were thrown into panic medb and fergus and the maines and the sons of mgu came up for this is how medb was wont to travel with nine chariots for herself alone two chariots before her two behind two on each side and her chariot between them in the very middle and the reason she used to do that was so that the clods of earth cast up by the horses hooves or the foam dripping from the bridlebits or the dust raised by the mighty army might not reach her and that no darkening might come to the golden diadem of the queen what is this said medb not hard to say they all answered these are the horses of the band that went in advance of us and their headless bodies in their chariots they held counsel and they decided that was the track of a multitude and the approach of a great army and that it was the men of ulster who came to them thus and this is what they decided on: to send cormac conn longes to find out who was at the ford for it the ulstermen were there they would not kill the son of their own king then cormac conn  p  line  longes mac conchobuir came with thirty hundred armed men to find out who was at the ford and when he got there he saw only the forked pole in the middle of the ford with four heads on it dripping blood down the stem of the pole into the current of the stream and the hoofmarks of the two horses and the track of a single charioteer and of a single warrior leading eastwards out of the ford the nobles of ireland came to the ford and they all fell to examining the forked pole they marvelled and wondered who had wrought the slaughter what name have ye for this ford until now fergus said ailill th ngrena said fergus and th ngabla shall be its name forever now from this forked pole  and he recited the lay:  fergus   th ngrena will change its name because of the deed performed by the strong fierce hound there is here a four pronged forked branch to bring fear on the men of ireland   on two if its prongs are the heads of fraech and fochnampresage of battle on its other two points are the heads of err and innell   what inscription is that on its side tell us o druids fair and who wrote that inscription on it how many drove it into the ground   yon forked branch with fearful strength that you see there o fergus one man cutand hail to himwith one perfect stroke of his sword   he pointed it and swung it back behind himno easy exploitand then flung it down that one of you might pluck it out of the ground   th ngrena was its name hitherto all will remember it ath ngabla will be its name forever from that forked branch which you see in the ford  after the lay: ailill said: i marvel and wonder fergus who would have cut the forked pole and slain so swiftly the four who  p  line went before us rather should you marvel and wonder at him who cut whole and entire the forked pole that you see with one stroke who sharpened and pointed it and made a cast of it from the back of his chariot with the tip of one hand so that it went two third of its length into the ground and only one third is above it and no hole was dug for it with his sword but it was driven in through the stony ground it is tabu for the men of ireland to go into the bed of this ford until one of you pluck out the pole with the tip of one hand even as he drove it in just now you are of our army fergus said medb so bring us the forked pole from the bed of the ford let me have a chariot said fergus a chariot was brought to fergus and he gave a tug to the forked pole and made fragments and small pieces of the chariot let a chariot be brought to me said fergus again a chariot is brought to fergus and he gave a strong pull to the forked pole and made fragments and small pieces of the chariot bring me a chariot said fergus he tugged the pole with all his strength and shattered the chariot into pieces as for the seventeen chariots of the connachtmen fergus broke them all to fragments and small pieces and yet he could not draw the pole from the bed of the ford give over fergus said medb do not break any more of my peoples chariots for had you not been on this hosting now we should already have reached the ulstermen and had our share of booty and herds we know why you are acting thus: it is to hold back and delay the host until such time as the ulstermen recover from their debility and give us battle the battle of the tin let a chariot be brought to me at once said fergus then his own chariot was brought to fergus and fergus gave a strong wrench to the forked pole and neither wheel nor pole nor shaft of the chariot creaked or groaned as was the strength and bravery with which it was driven in by him who had driven it in so was the might and valour with which the warrior drew it outfergus the gapbreaker of a hundred the sledge hammer of smiting the destructive stone of enemies the leader of resistance the enemy of multitudes the destroyer of a mighty army the blazing torch the commander of a great battle he drew it up with the tip of one hand until it reached the top of his shoulder and he put the forked pole in ailills hand and ailill looked at it the fork seems all the more perfect to me said ailill in that it is a single cutting i see on it from top to bottom all the more perfect indeed said fergus and he began to praise the forked pole and made this lay about it: p  line  fergus   here is the famous forked pole beside which harsh c chulainn stood and on which he leftto spite some one of youthe four heads of strangers   it is certain that he would not retreat from the forked pole at the approach of one man strong and fierce though the bright hound has left it blood remains on its hard bark   woe to him who will go eastward on the hosting to seek the cruel donn cailnge heroes will be cut in pieces by the baneful sword of c chulainn   no easy gain will be his strong bull for whom a fight will be fought with keen weapons when every skull has been tormented all the tribes of ireland will weep   i have no more to say concerning the son of deichtire but men and women shall hear of this pole as it now stands  after that lay: ailill said: let us pitch our tents and pavilions and let us prepare food and drink and let us make music and melody and let us eat and take food for it is unlikely that the men of ireland ever at any time experienced a night of encampment that held more hardship and distress for them than last night their encampments were set up and their tents pitched food and drink was prepared by them music and melody played and they ate a meal and ailill asked fergus a question: i marvel and wonder as to who would come to us on the marches and slay so swiftly the four who went in advance is it likely that conchobor mac fachtna fthaig the high king of ulster would come to us it is not likely indeed said fergus for it is lamentable to revile him in his absence there is nothing that he would not pledge for his honours sake for if it were he who had come armies and hosts and the pick of the men of ireland  ulster st  who are with him would have come too and even though the men of ireland and the men of scotland the britons and the saxons were opposed to him in one place and one meeting and one muster in one camp and on one hill he would give them all battle it is he who would win victory and it is not he who would be routed tell me then who was likely to have come to us was it perhaps cuscraid mend macha p  line mac conchobuir from inis cuscraid it was not likely said fergus son of the high king there is nothing he would not stake for the sake of his honour for if it were he who came the sons of kings and royal princes who are with him in mercenary service would also come and if there were before him in one spot and one ireland and the men of scotland the britons and the saxons he would give them all battle it is he who would be victorious and it is not he who would be routed tell me then would eogan mac durthacht the king of fernmag come to us it was not likely indeed for if it were he who came the steady men of fernmag would come with him and he would give battle etc tell me then who was likely to come to us was it celchair mac uthechair it was not likely indeed it is shameful to revile him in his absence he is the destructive stone of his enemies in the province he is leader of resistance to all he is the ulstermens doorway of battle and if there were before him in one spot ut ante together with all the men of ireland from west to east and from south to north he would give them battle he would be victorious and not he would be routed tell me then who would be likely to have come to us nay who but the little lad my fosterson and the fosterson of conchobor c chulainn na cerdda the hound of culann the smith he is called yes indeed said ailill i have heard you speak of that little lad once upon a time in crachu what is the age of that boy now it is not his age that is most troublesome indeed said fergus for the deeds of that boy were those of a man when he was younger than he is now how so said medb is there among the ulstermen now his equal in age who is more redoubtable than he we do not find there a wolf more bloodthirsty nor a hero more fierce nor any of his contemporaries who could equal the third or the fourth part of c chulainns warlike deeds you do not find there said fergus a hero his equal nor a sledgehammer of smiting nor doom of hosts nor a contest of valour who would be of more worth than c chulainn you do not find there one that could equal his age and his growth his size and his splendour his fearsomeness and his eloquence his harshness his feats of arms and his valour his bearing his attack and his assault his destructiveness his troublesomeness and his tumultuousness his quickness his speed and his violence and his swift victory with the feat of nine men on each pointed weapon  pointed weapon following lu st  above him we make but little account of him said p  line medb he has but one body he shuns wounding who evades capture his age is reckoned as but that of a nubile girl nor will that youthful beardless sprite ye speak of hold out against resolute men we do not say so said fergus for the deeds of that little boy were those of a man when he was younger than he now is here begin the youthful deeds of c chulainn fergus  for this boy was reared in the house of his father and mother at airgdig in mag muirtheimne and the stories of the youths of emain were told to him for this is how conchobor spends his time of kingship since he assumed sovereignty: as soon as he arises settling the cares and business of the province thereafter dividing the day into three the first third of the day spent watching the youths playing games and hurling the second third spent in playing brandub and fidchell and the last third spent in consuming food and drink until sleep comes on them all while minstrels and musicians are meanwhile lulling him to sleep though i am banished from him i swear said fergus that there is not in ireland or in scotland a warrior the counterpart of conchobor  the stories about the youths and boys in emain were told to that lad and the little lad asked his mother if he might go to play to the playingfield at emain it is too soon for you my son said his mother until there go with you a champion of the champions of ulster or some of the attendants of conchobor to ensure your safety and protection from the youths i think it long to wait for that mother said the little boy and i shall not wait for it but show me in what place lies emain far away from you is the spot where it lies said his mother slab fait is between you and emain i shall make a guess at it then said he  the boy went forth and took his playthings he took his hurleystick of bronze and his silver ball he took his little javelin for casting and his toy spear with its end sharpened by fire and he began to shorten the journey by playing with them he would strike his ball with the stick and drive it a long way from him then with a second stroke he would throw his stick so that he might drive it a distance no less than the first he would throw his javelin and he would cast his spear and would make a playful rush after them then he would catch his hurleystick and his ball  p  line and his javelin and before the end of his spear had reached the ground he would catch its tip aloft in the air he went on to the place of assembly in emain where the youths were there were thrice fifty youths led by follomain mac conchobuir at their games on the green of emain the little boy went on to the playingfield into their midst and caught the ball between his two legs when they cast it nor did he let it go higher than the top of his knee nor go lower than his ankle and he pressed it and held it close between his two legs and not one of the youths managed to get a grasp or a stroke or a blow or a shot at it and he carried the ball away from them over the goal  then they all gazed at him they wondered and marvelled well boys said follomain mac conchobuir attack yon fellow all of you and let him meet death at my hands for it is tabu for you that a youth should join your game without ensuring his protection from you attack him all together for we know that he is the son of an ulster chieftain and let them not make it a habit to join your games without putting themselves under your protection and safeguard  then they all attacked him together they cast their thrice fifty hurleysticks at the boys head he lifted up his single plaything stick and warded off the thrice fifty sticks then they cast the thrice fifty balls at the little boy he raised his arms and his wrists and his palms and warded off the thrice fifty balls they threw at him the thrice fifty toy spears with sharpened butt the boy lifted up his toy wooden shield and warded off the thrice fifty spears then he attacked them he threw fifty kings sons of them to the ground beneath him five of them said fergus went between me and conchobor in the spot where we were playing chess on the chessboard cendchaem on the mound of emain the little boy pursued them to cut them down conchobor seized the little lad by the arms nay lad i see that you do not deal gently with the youths i have good reason for that said the boy though i came from distant lands i did not get the honour due to a guest from the youths on my arrival why who are you asked conchobor i am little setanta mac sualtaim the son of deichtire your sister and not through you did i expect to be thus aggrieved why my lad said conchobor do you not know of the prohibition that the youths have and that it is tabu for them that a boy should come to them from outside and not first claim their protection i did not know said the little boy and if i had known i should have been on my guard  p  line against them well lads said conchobor undertake the protection of the little boy we grant it indeed say they the little boy placed himself under the protection of the youths then they loosed hands from him but once more he attacked them he threw fifty kings sons to the ground beneath him their fathers thought that he had killed them but it was not so he had merely terrified them with his many and violent blows nay said conchobor why do you still attack them i swear by my gods that until they in their turn all come under my protection and guarantee as i have done with them i shall not lift my hands from them until i bring them all low well little lad take on you the protection of the youths i grant it said the little boy then the youths placed themselves under his protection and guarantee  a little boy who did that deed said fergus at the end of five years after his birth and overthrew the sons of champions and warriors in front of their own fort and encampment there were no need of wonder or surprise that he should come to the marches and cut a fourpronged pole and kill one man or two men or three or four when his seventeen years are accomplished on tin b cailnge  then said cormac cond longas the son of conchobor: the year after that that little boy did a second deed what deed was that asked ailill  cormac cond longas  culand the smith dwelt in ulster he prepared a feast for conchobor and went to emain to invite him he told him to come with only a small number unless he could bring a few genuine guests for neither land nor domain had he but only his sledge hammers and his anvils his fists and his tongs conchobor said he would bring with him to culand only a small number  culand came on to his fort to prepare food and drink conchobor remained in emain until it was time to disperse when day drew to a close the king put on his light travelling garb and went to bid farewell to the youths conchobor went to the playingfield and saw something that astonished him: thrice fifty boys at one end of the field and a single boy at the other end and the single boy winning victory in taking the goal and in hurling from the thrice fifty youths when they played the hole gamea game which was played on the green of emainand when it was their turn to cast the ball and his to defend he would catch the thrice fifty balls outside the hole and none would go past him into the hole when it was their turn to keep goal and his to hurl he would put the thrice fifty balls unerringly into the hole when they played  p  line  at pulling off each otherss clothes he would tear their thrice fifty mantles off them and all of them together were unable to take even the brooch out of his cloak when they wrestled he would throw the same thrice fifty to the ground beneath him and a sufficient number of them to hold him could not get to him chonchobor began to examine the little boy ah my warriors said conchobor happy is the land from which came the little boy ye see if his manly deeds were to be like his boyish exploits it is not fitting to speak thus said fergus for as the little boy grows so also will his deeds of manhood increase with him let the little boy be summoned to us that he may go with us to share the feast to which we are going the little boy was summoned to conchobor well my lad said conchobor come with us to enjoy the feast to which we are going i shall not go indeed said the little boy why so asked conchobor because the youths have not yet had enough of play and games and i shall not go from them until they have had their fill of play it is too long for us to wait for you little lad and we shall not go on ahead said the little boy and i shall go after you you do not know the way at all little boy said chonchobor i shall follow the trail of the company and the horses and the chariots then conchobor came to the house of culand the smith the king was served and they were honoured according to rank and profession and rights and nobility and accomplishments reeds and fresh rushes were strewn beneath them they began to drink and make merry culand asked conchobor: good now o king have you appointed anyone to follow you tonight to this stronghold i have not said chonchobor for he did not remember the little boy he had appointed to come after him why so asked conchobor i have a good bloodhound and when his dogchain is taken off no traveller or wayfarer dares come into the same canton as he and he recognises no one but myself his strength is such that he can do the work of a hundred then said conchobor let the bloodhound be loosed for us that he may guard the canton his dogchain was loosed from the bloodhound and he made a swift circuit of the canton and he came to the mound where he was wont to be while guarding the dwelling and he lay there with his head on his paws and wild savage and here rough surly and battlesome was he who lay there  as for the youths they remained in emain until it was time for them disperse they went each of them to the house of his father and mother or of his fostermother and fosterfather but the little  p  line  boy went on the track of the company until he reached the house of culand the smith he began to shorten the way as he went with his playthings when he reached the green before the stronghold where culand and conchobor were he threw away all his playthings in front of him except his ball alone the bloodhound perceived the little boy and bayed at him and the baying of the bloodhound was heard throughout all the countryside and it was not a sharing out for a feast the hound was minded to make of the boy but rather to swallow him entire past the wall of his chest and the breadth of his throat and the midriff of his breast the boy had no means of defence but he made a cast of the ball and it went through the gaping mouth of the bloodhound and carried all his entrails out through the back way and the boy then seized him by two legs and dashed him against the standingstone so that he was scattered into pieces on the ground conchobor had heard the baying of the hound alas my warriors said conchobor would that we had not come to enjoy this feast why so asked they all the little boy who arranged to come after me my sisters son setanta mac sualtaim has been killed by the hound all the famous ulstermen rose with one accord though the gateway of the dwelling was wide open they all went to meet him out over the palisades of the stronghold though all reached him quickly quickest was fergus and he lifted the little boy from the ground on to his shoulder and brought him into the presence of conchobor and culand came forth and saw his bloodhound lying in scattered pieces his heart beat against his breast he went across into the stronghold then i welcome your arrival little boy said culand for the sake of your mother and your father but i do not welcome your arrival for your own sake why are you angry with the boy asked conchobor would that you had not come to consume my drink and eat my food for my substance now is substance wasted my livelihood a lost livelihood good was the servant you have taken from me he used to guard my herds and flocks and cattle for me be not angry at all master culandsaid the little boy for i shall deliver a true judgment in this matter what judgment would you deliver on it my lad said conchobor if there is a whelp of that hounds breeding in ireland he will be reared by me until he be fit for action like his sire i shall myself be the hound to protect culands flocks and cattle and land during that time a good judgement you have given little boy said conchobor i would not have given a better myself said cathbad why shall p  line  you not be called c chulainn culands hound because of this nay said the little boy i prefer my own name setanta mac sualtaim do not say that lad said cathbad for the men of ireland and of scotland shall hear of that name and that name shall be ever on the lips of the men of ireland and of scotland i am willing that it shall be my name said the boy hence the famous name of c chulainn clung to him since he killed the hound of culand the smith a little boy who performed that exploit said cormac cond longas six years after his birth who killed the bloodhound with which hosts and armies dared not be in the same canton there were no need to wonder or marvel that he should come to the marches and cut a fourpronged pole and kill one man or two or three or four now that his seventeen years are completed on tin b cailnge  the little boy performed a third exploit in the following year again said fiachu mac fir aba what exploit did he perform asked ailill  fiachu mac fir aba  cathbad the druid was teaching his pupils to the northeast of emain and eight pupils of the class of druidic learning were with him one of them asked his teacher what omen and presage was for that day whether it was good or whether it was ill then said cathbad that a boy who should take up arms on that day would be splendid and famous but would be shortlived and transient c chulainn heard that as he was playing southwest of emain and he threw aside all his playthings and went to conchobors sleeping chamber all good attend you o king of the warriors said the little boy that is the speech of a person making a request of someonewhat do you ask for little lad said conchobor i wish to take arms said the little boy who has advised you lad said conchobor cathbad the druid said the little boy he would not deceive you lad said conchobor conchobor gave him two spears and a sword and a shield the little boy shook and brandished the arms and shattered them into small pieces conchobor gave him two other spears and a shield and a sword he shook and brandished flourished and waved them and shattered them into small pieces as for the fourteen suits of arms which conchobor had in emain for the youths and boysfor to whichever one of them should take arms conchobor would give equipment of battle and the youth would have victory in his valour thereafterthat little boy made fragments and small pieces of them all  p  line  indeed these weapons are not good father conchobor said the little boy none of them suits me conchobor gave him his own two spears and his shield and his sword he shook and brandished and flourished and waved them so that the point of spears and sword touched the butt and yet he did not break the weapons and they withstood him these weapons are good indeed said the little boy they are suited to me i salute the king whose weapons and equipment these are i salute the land from which he came then cathbad the druid came into the tent and spoke is yon boy taking arms said cathbad he is indeed said conchobor not by your mothers son would i wish arms to be taken today said cathbad why is that is it not you who advised him said conchobor not i indeed said cathbad what mean you you distorted sprite said conchobor have you deceived me do not be angry father conchobor said the little boy for it is he who advised me for his pupil asked him what omen was for the day and he said that a boy who took arms on this day would be splendid and renowned but shortlived and transient i spoke truth said cathbad you will be splendid and renowned but short lived and transient it is a wonderful thing if i am but one day and one night in the world provided that my fame and my deeds live after me come little lad mount the chariot now for it is the same good omen for you  he mounted the chariot and the first chariot he mounted he shook and swayed around him and shattered it to pieces he mounted the second chariot and shattered it to pieces in the same way he made fragments of the third chariot also as for the seventeen chariots which conchobor had in emain to serve the youths and boys the little lad shattered them all to pieces and they withstood him not these chariots are not good father conchobor said the little boy none of these suits me where is ibar mac riangabra asked conchobor here answered ibar harness my own two horses for yon boy and yoke my chariot the charioteer harnessed the horses and yoked the chariot then the little boy mounted the chariot he rocked the chariot around him and it withstood him and did not break this chariot is good indeed said the little boy and it is my fitting chariot  well little boy said ibar let the horses go to their pasture now it is too soon yet ibar said the little boy come on around emain now for today is the first day i took  p  line  arms that it may be a triumph of valour for me they drove thrice around emain let the horses go to their pasture now little boy said ibar it is too soon yet ibar said the little boy come on so that the boys may wish me well for today is the first day i took arms they went forward to the place where the boys were is yon lad taking arms they asked yes indeed may it be for victory and first wounding and triumph but we deem it too soon that you took arms because you part from us in our games i shall not part from you at all but it is with a good omen i took arms to day let the horses go to their pasture now little boy said ibar it is still too soon ibar said the little boy and this great road which goes past us where does it lead said the little boy why do you bother about it said ibar you are an importunate fellow i see little lad said ibar i wish fellow to ask about the chief roads of the province how far does it go it goes to th na foraire on slab fait said ibar do you know why it is called th na foraire i do indeed said ibar a goodly warrior of the ulstermen is always there keeping watch and ward so that no warriors or strangers come to ulster to challenge them to battle and so that he may be the champion to give battle on behalf of the whole province and if poets leave ulstermen and the province unsatisfied that he may be the one to give them treasures and valuables for the honour of the province if poets come into the land that he may be the man who will be their surety until they reach conchobors couch and that their poems and songs may be the first to be recited in emain on their arrival do you know who is at that ford today i do indeed said ibar conall cernach mac amargin the heroic and triumphant the finest of the warriors of ireland said ibar go on fellow that we may reach the ford they drove forward in front of the ford where conall was is yon boy taking arms asked conall he is indeed said ibar may that be for victory and firstwounding and triumph said conall but we deem it too soon for you to take arms because you are not yet fit for action if he that should come hither needed protection for you would be complete surety for all the ulstermen and the nobles of the province would rise up at your summons what are you doing here master conall said the little boy i am keeping watch and ward for the province here lad said conall go home now master conall said the boy and let me keep watch for the province here nay p  line  little boy said conall you are not yet fit to meet a goodly warrior then i shall meanwhile go on southwards said the boy to fertais locha echtrand to see if i might redden my hands in the blood of a friend or an enemy today i shall go with you to protect you lad said conall that you may not go alone to the marches nay said the boy i shall indeed go with you said conall for the ulstermen will censure me if i let you go alone to the marches his horses are harnessed for conall and his chariot yoked and he went to protect the boy when conall came abreast of him the boy was certain that if the chance of performing a great deed were to come his way conall would not let him do it he took from the ground a stone which filled his fist he made a cast at the yoke of conalls chariot and broke it in two so that conall fell through the chariot on to the ground and his shoulder was dislocated what is this boy said conall it was i who cast a shot to see it my marksmanship was straight and in what way i shoot and to see if i am the makings of a good fighter a bane on your shot and a bane on yourself even if you leave your head with your enemies now i shall not go with you to guard you any more that is exactly what i asked you said he for it is tabu for you ulstermen to proceed on your way despite an insecure chariot conall came back again northwards to th na foraire  as for the little boy he went south to fertais locha echtrand he was there until the close of day if we might venture to say so little lad said ibar we would deem it time to go now to emain for already for some time the serving of meat and drink and the sharing out has been made in emain you have your appointed place there between conchobors knees every day you come there while my place is merely among the messengers and jesters of conchobors household i think it time for me to go and scramble for a place with them then harness the horses for us the charioteer harnesses the horses and the boy mounted the chariot well ibar what mound is that mound up there now that is slab moduirn said ibar and what is that white cairn on the top of the mountain that is findcharn slebe moduirn said ibar yon cairn is pleasant said the little boy it is pleasant indeed said ibar come on fellow to that cairn well you are an importunate boy said ibar but this is my first expedition with you it will be my last expedition for ever if once i reach emain however  p  line  they went to the summit of the hill well now ibar said the boy teach me all the places of ulster on every side for i do not know my way at all about the territory of conchobor the driver pointed out to him all the places of ulster all around him he told him the names of the hills and plains and mounds of the province on every side he pointed out the plains and strongholds and renowned places of the province well now ibar said the little boy what plain is that to the south of us which is full of retreats and corners and nooks and glens that is mag mbreg said ibar show me the buildings and renowned places of that plain the driver showed him temair and tailtiu cleitech and cnogba and brug meic in c and the fortress of the sons of nechta scene are not these the sons of nechta who boast that the number of ulstermen alive is not greater than the number of those ulstermen who have fallen at their hands they are indeed said the driver come on to the stronghold of the sons of nechta said the little lad woe to him who says that said ibar we know that it is a very foolish thing to say that whoever goes there said ibar it will not be i you shall go there alive or dead said the boy alive i shall go south said ibar but dead i know i shall be left at the stronghold of nechtas sons they went on to the stronghold and the boy leapt from the chariot on to the green thus was the green before the stronghold: there was a pillarstone on it and around the stone an iron ring a ring of heroic deeds with an ogam inscription on its peg and thus ran the inscription: if any man came on that green and if he were a warrior bearing arms it was tabu for him to leave the green without challenging to single combat the little boy read out the inscription and put his two arms around the stone that is the stone and its ring and he pitched it into the pool and the water closed over it it seems to us said ibar that that is no better than that it should remain where it was and we know that you will find on this green what you are looking for now namely symptoms of death and dissolution well now ibar settle the coverings and rugs of the chariot for me that i may sleep for a little while woe to him who says that said the driver for this is a land of enemies and not a green for pleasure the driver arranged the rugs and skincoverings of the chariot the little boy fell asleep on the green  then there came on to the green one of the sons of nechta foll mac nechtain do not unharness the horses driver  p  line  said fill i do not attempt it at all said ibar their traces and reins are still in my hand whose are these horses said fill conchobors two horses said the driver the two piebaldheaded ones i recognise them as such and what brought the horses here to the border of the marches a youthful lad of ours who took up arms said the driver he came to the edge of the marches to display his form may that not be for victory or triumph said fill had i known that he was old enough to fight his dead body would have returned north to emain and he would not have returned alive he is not old enough to fight indeed said ibar and it is not meet even to say so to him he is in but the seventh year from his birth the little boy raised his head from the ground and passed his hand over his face and he blushed crimson from head to foot i am indeed capable of action said the little boy it pleases me better than that you should say that you are not it will please you still better if only we meet on the ford but go and fetch your weapons for i see that you have come in cowardly fashion unarmed and i do not wound charioteers or messengers or those unarmed the fellow hastened to fetch his weapon it behoves you to act warily with yon man little lad said ibar why is that said the boy the man you see is fill mac nechtain no points nor weapons nor sharp edges harm him not to me should you say that ibar said the boy i shall take in hand for him my deil cliss that is the round ball of refined iron and it will land on the flat of his shield and the flat of his forehead and carry out through the back of his head a portion of brain equal to the iron ball and he will be holed like a sieve so that the light of the air will be visible through his head fill mac nechtain came forth c chulainn took in hand for him the deil cliss and hurled it so that it landed on the flat of his shield and the flat of his forehead and took the balls equivalent of his brains through the back of his head and he was holed like a sieve so that the light of the air was visible through his head and c chulainn struck off his head from his neck the second son tachall mac nechtain came forth on the green i see you would boast of that deed said tachall indeed i think it no cause for boasting to slay one warrior you will not boast of that now for you will fall by my hand go and fetch your weapons for you have come in cowardly fashion unarmed the fellow hastened to fetch his weapons you should have a care for yon fellow little lad said ibar  p  line  why so said the boy the man you see is tachall mac nechtain unless you get him with the first blow or the first cast or the first touch you will never do so so skilfully and craftily does he move around the points of the weapons not to me should that be said ibar said the boy i shall take in hand the great spear of conchobor the venomous lance it will land on the shield over his breast and having pierced his heart it will crush through a rib in the side that is farther from me it will be the cast of an outlaw not the blow of a freeman from me he shall not get until the day of doom any place where he may be cured or tended tachall mac nechtain came out on the green and the boy threw conchobors spear at him and it went through the shield over his breast and crushed through a rib in the side farther from c chulainn after piercing his heart in his chest c chulainn struck off his head before it reached the ground then came forth the youngest of the sons faindle mac nechtain on to the green foolish were they who fought with you here why is that said the boy come away down to the pool where your foot will not touch bottom faindle hastened on to the pool you should have a care for yon fellow little lad said ibar why so said the boy the man you see is faindle mac nechtain and he is so called because he travels over water like a swallow or squirrel the swimmers of the world cannot cope with him not to me should that be said ibar said the boy you know our river calland in emain when the youths surround it to play their games on it and when the pool is not safe i carry a boy over it on each of my two palms and a boy on each of my two shoulders and i myself do not wet even my ankles as i carry them they met upon the water and the boy clasped his arms around faindle and held him until the water came up flush with him and he dealt him a violent blow with conchobors sword and struck his head from his trunk letting the body go with the current and taking with him the head  then they went into the stronghold and pillaged the fort and fired it so that its buildings were level with its outer walls they turned about on their way to slab fait and took with them the three heads of the sons of nechta  they saw in front of them a herd of wild deer what are these numerous fierce cattle ibar said the boy are they tame or are they deer they are deer indeed said ibar that is a herd of wild deer which frequent the recesses of slab fait ply the goad on the horses for us that we may catch  p  line  some of them the charioteer plied the goad on the horses the kings fat horses could not keep up with the deer the boy dismounted and caught two swift strong stags he tied them to the shafts and ropes and thongs of the chariot they went forward to the mound of emain they saw a flock of white swans fly past them what kind of birds are those ibar said the boy are they tame or just birds just birds said ibar they are a flock of swans which come in from the crags and rocks and islands of the ocean to feed on the plains and level spots of ireland which would be the more wonderful to bring them alive to emain or to bring them dead ibar said the boy more wonderful indeed to bring them alive said ibar for not everyone can catch the living birds then the boy cast a small stone at them he brought down eight of the birds then he cast a big stone and brought down sixteen of the birds bring hither the birds ibar said the boy i am in a predicament said ibar how is that said the boy i have good reason to say so if i move from where i am the iron wheels of the chariot will cut me down so fierce and so powerful  and so strong is the pace of the horses if i stir at all the stags antlers will pierce and gore me ah no true warrior are you ibar said the boy for with the look that i shall give the horses they will not break their straight course and with the look that i shall give the deer they will bow their heads in awe and fear of me and it will not matter to you even if you stepped across their antlers then ibar tied the birds to the shafts and cords and thongs and strings and ropes of the chariot  they went forward and came to emain then leborcham perceived them she was the daughter of a and adarc a single chariotwarrior is here said leborcham and terribly he comes he has in the chariot the bloody heads of his enemies there are beautiful purewhite birds held  by him in the chariot he has wild untamed deer bound and tied and fettered if he be not met tonight the warriors of ulster will fall at his hand we know that chariotwarrior said conchobor it is the little boy my sisters son who went to the marches and shed blood there but he has not had his fill of combat and if he be not met all the warriors of emain will fall by his hand and the plan they devised was this: to send the women folk out to meet the boy thrice fifty women that is ten and seven score women all stark naked led by their chieftainess scannlach to  p  line  expose all their nakedness and shame to him all the young women came forth and discovered all their nakedness and shame to him the boy hid his face from them and laid his countenance against the chariot that he might not see the womens nakedness then the boy was lifted out of the chariot he was placed in three vats of cold water to quench the ardour of his wrath the first vat into which the boy was put burst its staves and hoops like the breaking of a nutshell about him as for the second vat the water would seethe several handbreadths high in it as for the third vat the water grew hot in it so that one man might endure it while another would not thereupon the boys wrath abated and his garments were put were put following st  on him his comely appearance was restored and he blushed crimson from head to foot he had seven toes on each of his feet and seven fingers on each of his hands he had seven pupils in each of his royal eyes and seven gems sparkling in each pupil four dimples in each cheek a blue dimple a purple a green and a yellow fifty tresses of hair he had between one ear and the other bright yellow like the top of a birchtree or like brooches of pale gold shining in the sun he had a high crest of hair bright fair as if a cow had licked it he wore a green mantle in which was a silver pin and a tunic of thread of gold the boy was placed between conchobors knees and the king began to stroke his hair a little lad who did those deeds when he was seven years old who overcame the champions and warriors by whom two thirds of the men of ulster had fallen and had been unavenged until this boy arose there were no need to wonder or marvel that he should come to the marches and kill one man or two or three or four when his seventeen years were completed at the time of the cattleraid of cailnge  thus far then is some account of the youthful deeds of c chulainn on the cattleraid of cailnge together with the prologue of the tale and an account of the route and march of the host out of crachu  the story proper is what follows now the four great provinces of ireland came the next day eastwards over cruinn that is the mountain called cruinn c chulainn went ahead of them he met the charioteer of rlm the son of ailill and medb who was at tamlachta rlim to the north of  p  line  dsert lochad cutting chariot poles from a hollytree in the wood well leg said c chulainn boldly do the ulstermen behave if it is they who are thus cutting down the wood in front of the men of ireland and do you stay here for a little while until i find out who is cutting down the wood in this manner then c chulainn went on and came upon the charioteer what are you doing here lad asked c chulainn i am cutting the chariot poles from a hollytree here said the driver for our chariots broke yesterday hunting that famous deer c chulainn and by your valour warrior come to my help lest that famous c chulainn come upon me take your choice lad said c chulainn either to gather the poles or to strip them i shall gather them for it is easier c chulainn began to strip the poles and he would draw them between his toes and between his fingers against their bends and knots until he made them smooth and polished and slippery and trimmed he would make them so smooth that a fly could not stay on them by the time he cast them from him then the charioteer looks at him indeed it seems to me that it was not a labour befitting you that i imposed on you who are you asked the driver i am the famous c chulainn of whom you spoke just now woe is me cried the charioteer for that am i done for i shall not slay you lad said c chulainn for i do not wound charioteers or messengers or men unarmed and where is your master anyway over yonder on the mound said the charioteer go to him and warn him to be on his guard for if we meet he will fall at my hands then the charioteer went to his master and swiftly as the charioteer went more swiftly still went c chulainn and struck off rlms head and he raised the head aloft and displayed it to the men of ireland then came the three meic rach on to the ford at ard ciannacht to meet with c chulainn lon and ualu and dliu were their names mes lir and mes laig and mes lethair were the names of their charioteers they came to encounter c chulainn because they deemed excessive what he had done against them the previous day namely killing the two sons of nera mac nuatair meic thacin at th gabla and killing rlm the son of ailill and medb as well and displaying his head to the men of ireland they came then that they might kill c chulainn in the same way and bear away his head as a trophy they went to the wood and cut three rods of white hazel to put in the hands of their charioteers so that all six of them together might fight with c  p  line  chulainn c chulainn attacked them and cut off their six heads thus fell meic rach by the hand of c chulainn there came also lethan on to his ford on the nth in the district of conaille muirtheimne to fight with c chulainn he attacked him on the ford th carpait was the name of the ford where they reached it for their chariots had been broken in the fighting at the ford mulchi fell on the hill between the two fords whence it is still called galu mulchi then c chulainn and lethan met and lethan fell by the hand of c chulainn who cut off his head from his trunk on the ford but he left it with it that is he left his head with his body whence the name of the ford ever since is th lethan in the district of conaille muirtheimne  then came the harpers of canbile from ess ruaid to entertain them the men of ireland thought that they had come from the ulstermen to spy on them so the hosts hunted them vigorously for a long distance until they escaped from them transformed into wild deer at the standingstones at lia mr for though they were called the harpers of canbile they were men of great knowledge and prophecy and magic  then c chulainn vowed that wherever he saw medb he would cast a stone at her and it would not go far from the side of her head it happened as he said where he saw medb to the west of the ford he cast a stone from his sling at her and killed the pet bird on her shoulder medb went eastwards over the ford and he cast another stone from his sling at her east of the ford and killed the pet marten which was on her shoulder whence the names of those places are still meide in togmaill and mede ind ein and th srethe is the name of the ford across which c chulainn cast the stone from his sling  the four great provinces of ireland came on the morrow and began to ravage mag mbreg and mag muirtheimne and there came to fergus c chulainns fosterfather a keen premonition of the arrival of c chulainn and he told the men of ireland to be on their guard that night for c chulainn would come upon them and he praised him here again as we have written above and chanted a lay:  fergus  c chulainn of cailnge will come upon you in advance of the heroes of crebrad men will be bloodily wounded because of the harrying of mag muirtheimne  p  line  for c chulainn went a longer journey than this as far as the mountains of armenia he waged combat beyond his wont he slaughtered the amazons  more difficult was it for him to drive the sons of nechta from their couches and to slay with one hand the hound of the smithvalorous deed  i have no more to say concerning deichteres son i swear that in truth though you reach him not he will come to you  after that lay: on the same day the donn cailnge came to crch mairgn and with him fifty heifers and he pawed up the earth that is he cast the turf over him with his heels on the same day the morrgu daughter of ernmas came from the fairymounds and sat on the pillarstone in temair cailnge warning the donn cailnge against the men of ireland she began to speak to him and she said: good now o pitiful one donn cailnge be on your guard for the men of ireland will come upon you and will carry you off to their encampment unless you take heed and she began to warn him thus and spoke these words aloud: nach fitir etcgap: untranslated rhetoricextent:  lines then donn cailnge came and advanced into glenn na samaisce in slab culind with fifty of his heifers  here are some of the virtues of the donn cailnge: he would bull fifty heifers every day these would calve before the same hour on the following day and those of them that did not calve would burst with the calves because they could not endure the begetting of the donn cailnge it was one of the virtues of the donn cailnge that fifty youths used to play games every evening on his back another of his virtues was that he used to protect a hundred warriors from heat and cold in his shadow and shelter it was one of his virtues that no spectre or sprite or spirit of the glen dared to come into one and the same canton as he it was one of his virtues that each evening as he came to his byre and his shed and his haggard he used to make a musical lowing which was enough melody and delight for a man in the north and in the south and in the middle of the district of cailnge those are some of the virtues of donn cailnge  p  then on the morrow the hosts came into the rocks and dunes  of conaille muithemne and medb ordered that a shelter of shields should be placed over her lest c chulainn should make a cast at her from hills or heights or mounds however on that day c chulainn did not succeed in wounding or attacking the men or ireland in the rocks and dunes of conaille muirthemne  the men of the four great provinces of ireland spent that night in rede loche in cailnge and pitched their camps there medb told a handmaid of her household to go to the river and fetch her water for drinking and washing loche was the maids name then loche came wearing the golden diadem of the queen on her head and accompanied by fifty women and c chulainn cast a stone at her from his sling and broke in three the golden diadem and killed the girl on the plain where she was whence is the name rede loche in cailnge for c chulainn had thought for want of knowledge and information that it was medb who was there  on the morrow the hosts went as far as the river glais cruind and they tried to cross the glaise but failed to do so clain carpat is the name of the first place where they reached it and that spot is called clain carpat because the glaise carried a hundred of their chariots away to the sea medb asked of her people that a warrior from amongst them should go and test the depth of the river a great and valiant warrior of medbs household called alu rose up and took on his back a huge rock and he came to test the depth of the stream and the river glais swept him back dead and lifeless with his stone on his back medb ordered him to be brought up out of the river and his grave dug and his stone raised whence the name lia aland in the district of cailnge  c chulainn kept very close to the hosts that day inviting them to fight and do combat and killed a hundred of their warriors including ren and ro the two historians of the foray  medb ordered her people to go and fight and do combat with c chulainn it will not be i and it will not be i said one and all from the place where they were no captive is due from my people even if he were it is not i who would go to oppose c chulainn for it is no easy task to encounter him  the hosts proceeded along the side of the river glaise since they were unable to cross it and they reached the spot where the  p  line  glaise rises in the mountain if they wished they could have gone between the glaise and the mountain but medb did not permit it but ordered them to dig and hack a path for her through the mountain so that it might be a reproach and disgrace to the ulstermen since then bernais tna b cailnge is the name of that place for afterwards the drove of cattle was taken through it the men of the four great provinces of ireland encamped that night at belat ailein until then its name was belat ailein but from that time its name was glenn til because of the great amount of milk which the herds and cattle yielded there to the men of ireland and lasa lac is another name for that place it is so called because it was there that the men of ireland built byres and enclosures for their herds and their cattle  the men of the four great provinces of ireland came on as far as sechair sechair was the name of the river until then but glas gatlaig is its name ever since it is so called because the men of ireland brought their herds and cattle across it tied with withes and ropes and when they had crossed the hosts let their withes and ropes drift down the stream hence the name of glas gatlaig  that night the men of the four great provinces of ireland came and encamped in druim en in the district of conaille muirthemne and c chulainn took up his position close beside them at ferta in lerga and that night c chulainn waved and brandished and shook his weapons so that a hundred warriors among the host died of fright and fear and dread of c chulainn medb told fiachu mac fir aba of the ulstermen to go and parley with c chulainn and to offer him terms what terms would be offered him asked fiachu mac fir aba not hard to say answered medb he shall be compensated for the damage done to ulstermen that he may be paid as the men of ireland best adjudge he shall have entertainment at all times in crachu and wine and mead shall be served to him and he shall come into my service and into the service of ailill for that is more advantageous for him than to be in the service of the petty lord with whom he now isand that is the most scornful and insulting speech that was made on the foray of cailnge namely to call conchobor the finest king of a province in ireland a petty lord  then came fiachu mac fir aba to parley with c chulainn c chulainn welcomed him i trust that welcome you may well trust it to parley with you have i come from medb what terms did you bring compensation shall be  p  line  made to you for the damage done to the ulstermen that you may be paid as the men of ireland best adjudge you shall have entertainment in crachu and be served with wine and mead and you shall enter the service of ailill and of medb for that is more advantageous for you than to be in the service of the petty lord with whom you now are no indeed said c chulainn i would not exchange my mothers brother for another king come early tomorrow to glenn fochane to a meeting with medb and fergus then early on the morrow c chulainn came to glenn fochane medb and fergus came there too to meet him and medb gazed at c chulainn and in her own mind she belittled him for he seemed to her no more than a boy is that the famous c chulainn of whom you speak fergus asked medb and medb began to speak to fergus and made the lay:  medb   if that is the fair hound of whom ye ulstermen speak no man who faces hardship but can ward him off from the men of ireland  fergus   though young the hound you see there who rides over mag muirthemne no man who places foot on earth but he will repel in single combat  medb   let terms be taken from us to the warrior he is mad if he violate them he shall have half his cows and half his womenfolk and let him change his way of fighting  fergus   i wish that the hound from great muirthemne be not defeated by you i know that if it be he he fears no fierce or famous deed of arms  speak you to c chulainn fergus said medb nay said fergus rather speak to him yourself for ye are not far apart in this glen glenn fochare and medb began to address c chulainn and chanted a lay:  medb   o c chulainn renowned in song ward off from us your sling your fierce famed fighting has overcome us and confused us  p  line  c chulainn  o medb from mr mac mgach i am no inglorious coward as long as i live i shall not yield to you the driving of the herd of cailnge  medb   if you would accept from us o triumphant hound of cailnge half your cows and half your womenfolk you will get them from us through fear of you  you  you following st   c chulainn   since i by virtue of those i have slain am the veteran who guards ulster i shall accept no terms until am given every milch cow every women of the gael  medb   too greatly do you boast after slaughtering our nobles that we should keep guard on the best of our steeds the best of our possessions all because of one man  c chulainn   o daughter of eochu find fil i am no good in such a contention though i am a warriorclear omenmy counsels are few  medb   no reproach to you is what you say manyretinued son of deichtere the terms are such as will bring fame to you o triumphant c chulainn  after that lay: c chulainn accepted none of the terms that medb asked of him in that manner they parted in the glen and each side withdrew equally angry  the men of the four great provinces of ireland encamped for three days and three nights at druim en in conaille muirthemne but neither huts nor tents were set up nor was meal or repast eaten by them and no music or melody was played by them during those three nights and every night until the bright hour of sunrise on the morrow c chulainn used to kill a hundred of their warriors not long will our hosts last in this manner said medb if c chulainn kill a hundred of our men every night why do we not offer him terms and why do we not parley with him what terms are those asked ailill let him be offered those of the cattle that have milk and those of the captives who are baseborn and let him cease to ply his sling on the men of ireland and let him allow the hosts at least to sleep who  p  line  will go with those terms asked ailill who else but mac roth the messenger said medb i shall not go indeed said mac roth for i do not know the way and i do not know where c chulainn is ask fergus said medb it is likely that he knows i do not know said fergus but i should think that he might be between fochan and the sea exposing himself to wind and sun after his sleeplessness last night when singlehanded he slew and demolished the host it was as fergus had said heavy snow fell that night so that all the provinces of ireland were one white expanse and c chulainn cast off the twentyseven shirts waxed and hard as boards which used to be bound to his skin with ropes and cords so that his sense might not be deranged when his fit of fury came upon him the snow melted for thirty feet around him on all sides so great was the ardour of the warrior and so hot the body of c chulainn and the charioteer could not remain near him because of the greatness of the fury and ardour of the warrior and because of the heat of his body  a single warrior comes towards us little c said leg what kind of warrior asked c chulainn a darkhaired handsome broadfaced fellow a fine brown cloak about him a bronze pin in his cloak a strong plaited shirt next to his skin two shoes between his feet and the ground he carries a staff of white hazel in one hand and in the other a oneedged sword with guards of ivory well driver said c chulainn those are the tokens of a messenger that is one of the messengers of ireland coming to speak and parley with me  then mac roth arrived at the spot where leg was whose vassal are you fellow  whose  fellow follwing st   asked mac roth i am vassal to the warrior up yonder said the driver mac roth came to the spot where c chulainn was whose vassal are you warrior whose  warrior following st   asked mac roth i am the vassal of conchobor mac fachtna fthaig have you no information more exact than thatthat is enough for now said c chulainn find out for me where i might find that famous c chulainn whom the men of ireland are hunting now on this hosting what would you say to him that you would not say to me asked c chulainn i have come from ailill and medb to parley with him and to offer him terms and peace what terms have you brought him all that are milch of the kine all that are baseborn among the p  line  captives on condition that he cease to ply his sling against the hosts for not pleasant is the thunder feat he performs against them every evening even if he whom you seek were at hand he would not accept the proposals you ask for the ulstermen if they have no dry cows will kill their milch cows for companies and satirists and guests for the sake of their honour and they will take their lowborn women to bed and thus there will arise in the land of ulster a progeny which is base on the side of the mothers mac roth went back did you not find him asked medb i found a surly angry fearsome fierce fellow between fochan and the sea i do not know if he is the famed c chulainn did he accept those terms he did not indeed and mac roth told them the reason why he did not accept it was c chulainn to who you spoke said fergus let other terms be taken to him said medb what terms asked ailill all the dry kine of the herds all the noble among the captives and let him cease to ply his sling on the hosts for not pleasant is the thunder feat he performs against them every evening who will go with those terms who but mac roth i shall indeed go said mac roth for now i know the way mac roth came to speak to c chulainn  i have come now to speak with you for i know that you are the famous c chulainn what terms did you bring with you then all the dry kine in the herd all the noblyborn among the captives and cease to ply your sling against the men of ireland and let them sleep for not pleasant is the thunder feat you perform against them every evening i shall not accept those terms for the ulstermen will kill their dry kine for the sake of their honour for ulstermen are generous and ulstermen will be left without any dry cattle or any milch cattle they will set their freeborn women to work at querns and kneading troughs and bring them into slavery and servile work i do not wish to leave after me in ulster the reproach of having made slaves and bondwomen of the daughters of the kings and royal leaders of ulster are there any terms at all that you accept now there are indeed said c chulainn do you tell me terms then asked mac roth i vow said c chulainn that it is not i who will tell them to you who then asked mac roth if you have within the camp said c chulainn some one who should know my terms let him tell you and if you have not let no one come any more to me offering terms or peace for whoever so comes that will be the length of his life mac roth went back  p  line  and medb asked him for news did you find him said medb i did indeed said mac roth did he accept asked medb he did not said mac roth are there any terms which he accepts there are he says did he make known those terms to you what he said answered mac roth was that it will not be he who will tell you them who then asked medb but if there is among us one who should know the terms he asks let him tell me and if there is not let no one ever again come near him but there is one thing i assert said mac roth even if you were to give me the kingship of ireland i myself shall not go to tell them to him then medb gazed at fergus what terms does yonder man demand fergus said medb i see no advantage at all for you in the terms he asks said fergus what terms are those said medb that one man from the men of ireland should fight him every day while that man is being killed the army to be permitted to continue their march then when he has killed that man another warrior to be sent to him at the ford or else the men of ireland to remain in camp there until the bright hour of sunrise on the morrow and further c chulainn to be fed and clothed by you as long as the foray lasts  by my conscience said ailill those are grievous terms what he asks is good said medb and he shall get those terms for we deem it preferable to lose one warrior every day rather than a hundred warriors every night who will go and tell those terms to c chulainn who but fergus said medb no said fergus why not asked ailill let pledges and covenants bonds and guarantees be given for abiding by those terms and for fulfilling them to c chulainn i agree to that said medb and fergus bound them to security in the same way  ferguss horses were harnessed and his chariot yoked and his two horses were harnessed for etarcumul son of fid and of lethrinn a stripling of the household of medb and ailill where are you going asked fergus we are going with you said etarcumul to see the form and appearance of c chulainn and to gaze upon him if you were to follow my counsel said fergus you would not come at all why so because of your haughtiness and your arrogance and also because of the fierceness and the valour and the savageness of the lad against whom you go for i think that there will be strife between you before ye part  p  line  will you not be able to make intervention between us said etarcumul i shall said fergus if only you yourself will not seek contention and strife contention and strife following st   i shall never seek that then they went forward to c chulainn where he was between fochan and the sea playing banbach with his charioteer and no one came into the plain unnoticed by leg and yet he used to win every second game of banbach from c chulainn a single warrior comes towards us little c said leg what manner of warrior is he asked c chulainn it seems to me that the chariot of the warrior is as big as one of the greatest mountains on a vast plain it seems to me that the curly thick fair yellow golden hair hanging loose around his head is as great as the foliage of one of the tall trees which stand on the green before a great fort he wears a purple fringed mantle wrapped around him with a golden inlaid brooch in it a broad grey spear flashing in his hand a bossed scalloped shield over him with a boos of red gold a long sword as long as a ships rudder  a long  rudder following lu and st   firmly fixed and resting on the two thighs of the great proud warrior who is within the chariot welcome is the arrival to us of this guest said c chulainn we know that man it is my master fergus who comes i see another chariotwarrior coming towards us also with much skill and beauty and splendour do his horses advance that is one of the youths of the men of ireland friend leg said c chulainn to see my form and appearance that man comes for i am renowned among them within their encampment fergus arrived and sprang from the chariot and c chulainn bade him welcome i trust that welcome said fergus you may well trust it said c chulainn for if a flock of birds pass over the plain you shall have one wild goose and the half of another if fish swim into the estuaries you shall have a salmon with the half of another you shall have a handful of watercress and a handful of seaweed and a handful of water parsnip if you must fight or do battle i shall go to the ford on your behalf and you shall be watched over and guarded while you sleep and rest well indeed we know what provisions for hospitality you have now on the foray of cailnge but the condition that you asked of the men of ireland namely single combat you shall have it i came to bind you to that so undertake to fulfil it i agree indeed master fergus p  line  said c chulainn and he delayed no longer than that conversing lest the men of ireland should say that fergus was betraying them to his fosterling his two horses were harnessed for fergus and his chariot was yoked and he went back etarcumul remained behind him gazing at c chulainn for a long while what are you staring at lad said c chulainn i am staring at you said etarcumul you have not far to look indeed said c chulainn you redden your eye with that but if only you knew it the little creature you are looking at namely myself is wrathful and how do you find me as you look at me i think you are fine indeed you are a comely splendid handsome youth with brilliant numerous various feats of arms but as for reckoning you among goodly heroes or warriors or champions or sledgehammers of smiting we do not do so nor count you at all you know that it is a guarantee for you that you came out of the camp under the protection of my master fergus but i swear by the gods whom i worship that but for ferguss protection only your shattered bones and your cloven joints would return to the camp nay do not threaten me any longer thus for as for the condition you asked of the men of ireland namely single combat none other of the men of ireland than i shall come to attack you tomorrow come on then and however early you come you will find me here i shall not flee from you etarcumul went back and began to converse with his charioteer i must needs fight with c chulainn tomorrow driver said etarcumul you have promised it indeed said the charioteer but i know not if you will fulfil your promise which is better to do so tomorrow or at once tonight it is my conviction said the driver that though doing it tomorrow means no victory yet still less is to be gained by doing it tonight for the fight is nearer  for destruction is nearer tonight st   turn the chariot back again for me driver for i swear by the gods whom i worship never to retreat until i carry off as a trophy the head of yon little deer c chulainn the charioteer turned the chariot again towards the ford they turned the left board of the chariot towards the company as they made for the ford leg noticed that the last chariot fighter who was here a while ago little c said leg what of him said c chulainn he turned his left board towards us as he made for the ford that is etarcumul driver seeking combat of me and i did not welcome him because of the guarantee of  p  line  my fosterfather under which he came out of the camp and not because i wish to protect him bring my weapon to the ford for me driver i do not deem it honourable that he should reach the ford before me then c chulainn went to the ford and unsheathed his sword over his fair shoulder and was ready to meet etarcumul at the for etarcumul arrived also what are you seeking lad asked c chulainn i seek combat with you said etarcumul if you would take my advice you would not come at all said c chulainn i say so because of the guarantee of fergus under which you came out of the encampment and not at all because i wish to protect you then c chulainn gave a flow fotalbeim and cut away the sod from beneath the sole of his foot so that he was cast prostrate with the sod on his belly if c chulainn had so wished he could have cut him in two begone now for i have given you warning i shall not go until we meet again said etarcumul c chulainn gave him an edgeblow febarbeim he sheared his hair from him from poll to forehead and from ear to ear as if it had been shaved with a keen light razor he drew not a drop of blood begone now said c chulainn for i have drawn ridicule on you i shall not go until we meet again until i carry off your head and spoils and triumph over you or until you carry off my head and spoils and triumph over me the last thing you say is what will happen and i shall carry off your head and spoils and i shall triumph over you c chulainn dealt him a blow madalbeim on the crown of his head which split him to his navel he gave him a second blow crosswise so that the three sections into which his body was cut fell at one and the same time to the ground thus perished etarcumul son of fid and leithrinn fergus did not know that this fight had taken place that was but natural for sitting and rising journeying or marching in battle or fight or combat fergus never looked behind him lest anyone should say that it was out of fearfulness he looked back but he was wont to gaze at what was before him and on a level with him etarcumuls charioteer came abreast of fergus where is your master driver asked fergus he fell on the ford just now by the hand of c chulainn said the driver it was not right said fergus for that distorted sprite clainn to outrage me concerning him who came there under my protection turn the chariot for us driver said fergus that we may go and speak with c chulainn  p  line  then the charioteer turned the chariot they went off towards the ford why did you violate my pledge you distorted sprite said fergus concerning him who came under my safeguard and protection by the nurture and care you gave me tell me which you would prefer that he should triumph over me or that i should triumph over him moreover enquire of his driver which of us was at fault against each other i prefer what you have done a blessing on the hand that struck him  then two withes were tied round etarcumuls ankles and he was dragged along behind his horses and his chariot at every rough rock he met his lungs and liver were left behind on the stones and rocks  wherever it was smooth for him his scattered joints came together around the horses thus he was dragged across the camp to the door of the tent of ailill and medb here is your youth for you said fergus for every restoration has its fitting restitution medb came out to the door of her tent and raised her voice aloud we thought indeed said medb that great was the ardour and wrath of this young hound when he went forth from the camp in the morning we thought that the guarantee under which he went the guarantee of fergus was not that of a coward what has crazed the peasantwoman said fergus is it right for the common cur to seek out the bloodhound whom the warriors of the four great provinces of ireland dare not approach or withstand even i myself would be glad to escape whole from him thus fell etarcumul  that is the story of the encounter of etarcumul and c chulainn  then there rose up a great and valiant warrior of medbs household called nath crantail and he came to attack c chulainn he scorned to bring with him any arms except thrice nine spits of holly which were sharpened charred and pointed by fire and c chulainn was on the pond before himand as for the pond it was not safe but there were nine spits fixed in it and c chulainn used not to miss a single spit of themthen nath crantail cast a spit at c chulainn c chulainn stepped on to the upper point of the spit which nath crantail had cast nath crantail cast a second spit he cast a third spit and c chulainn stepped from the tip of the second spit on to the tip of the last spit  then the flock of birds flew out of the plain c chulainn pursued them as swift as any bird that they might not escape him but might leave him that evenings meal for what sufficed  p  line  and served c chulainn on the foray of cailnge was fish and fowl and venison however nath crantail was sure that c chulainn fled in defeat from him so he went forward to the door of the tent of medb and ailill and lifted up his voice: this famous c chulainn of whom ye speak said nath crantail has fled in rout before me just now we knew said medb that that would happen and that if only goodly heroes and warriors came to meet him the young and beardless sprite would not withstand resolute men for when a goodly warrior came to him he did not hold out against him but was routed by him fergus heard that and he was greatly grieved that any man should taunt c chulainn with having fled and fergus told fiachu mac fir aba to go and speak with c chulainn and tell him that it was seemly for him to attack the hosts as long as he performed deeds of valour upon them but that it were fitter for him to hide himself rather than to flee before a single warrior from among them then fiachu came to speak with c chulainn c chulainn bade him welcome i trust that welcome but i have come to speak to you from your fosterfather fergus he said that it was seemly for you to attack the hosts as long as you did deeds of valour but that it were more fitting for you to hide yourself than to flee before a single man of their warriors why who among you boasts of that asked c chulainn nath crantail said fiachu why do you not know you and fergus and the nobles of ulster that i do not wound charioteers or messengers or folk unarmed no weapons had nath crantail only a wooden spit and i would not wound him until he had a weapon tell him to come to me here early in the morning tomorrow and i shall not flee from him it seemed long to nath crantail until it was bright day for him to attack c chulainn early on the morrow he came to attack him c chulainn rose early on that day and a fit of rage came on him and he angrily cast a fold of his cloak around him so that it wrapped itself round the pillarstone and he dragged the pillarstone out of the ground between himself and his cloak and he knew nothing of this because of the greatness of his rage and he became distorted then came nath crantail and said: where is this c chulainn over yonder said cormac cond longas mac conchobuir that is not how he appeared to me yesterday said nath crantail then repel yon warrior said cormac and it is the same as if you repelled c chulainn p  line  then nath crantail came and cast his sword at c chulainn and it struck the pillarstone which was between c chulainn and his cloak and the sword broke on the pillarstone c chulainn jumped from the ground to the top of the boss of nath crantails shield and dealt him a return blow past the top of the shield and cut off his head from his trunk quickly he raised his hand again and dealt him another blow on the top of the trunk and cut him into two severed parts down to the ground thus fell nath crantail by the hand of c chulainn thereafter c chulainn said:  if nath crantail has fallen there will be increase of strife alas that battle cannot now be given to medb with a third of the host  after that medb with a third of the army of the men of ireland proceeded as far north as dn sobairche and c chulainn followed her closely that day and medb went to cuib ahead of c chulainn and after he had gone northwards c chulainn killed fer taidle whence the placename taidle and he killed the sons of bachaill whence the name carn mac mbachalla and he killed lasce in leitre whence leitre lasce he killed b bulge in his swamp from which comes the name grellach b bulge he killed muirthemne on his hill whence the name delga muirthemne  after that c chulainn came southwards again to protect and guard his own land and territory for it was dearer to him than the land and territory of any other  then there met him fir crandce the two artines and the two sons of lecc and the two sons of durcride and the two sons of gabal and drcht and delt and dathen te and tualang and turscur tore glaisse and glas and glaisnethese are the same as the twenty fir fochard c chulainn overtook them as they were pitching their camp ahead of the rest and they fell by him  then there met c chulainn buide mac bin blai from the land of ailill and medb one of medbs household twentyfour warriors was the number of his company each man wore a mantle wrapped around him donn cailnge was driven hastily and forcibly in front of them after he had been brought from glenn na samaisce in slab culind together with fifty of his heifers whence do ye bring the drove asked c chulainn from yonder mountain said buide what is your own name asked c chulainn one who loves you not who fears you not said buide i am buide mac bin blai from the land of  p  line  ailill and medb here is this little spear for you said c chulainn and he cast the spear at him the spear landed in the shield above his breast and crushed three ribs in the farther side after piercing his heart and buide mac bin blai fell hence the name th mbuide in crch rois ever since while they were thus engaged exchanging the two short spearsfor not at once did they finishthe donn cailnge was carried off hastily and forcibly from them to the encampment as any cow might be taken that was the greatest reproach and grief and madness that was inflicted on c chulainn in this hosting  as for medb every ford at which she stopped is called th medbe every place where she erected her tent is called pupall medba and every spot where she planted her horse whip is called bile medba  on this expedition medb gave battle to findmr the wife of celtchair in front of dn sobairche and she slew findmr and ravaged dn sobairche  after a fortnight the men of the four great provinces of ireland came to the encampment together with medb and ailill and the men who were bringing the bull but the bulls herdsman did not allow them to carry off donn cailnge so despite him they urged on both bull and heifers by beating their shields with sticks and drove them into a narrow pass and the cattle trampled the body of the herdsman thirty feet into the ground and made small fragments of his body forgemen was his name  bs forgaimin is the name of that tale in the foray of cailnge  when the men of ireland reached one spot together with medb and ailill and the men who were bringing the bull to the camp they all said that c chulainn would be no more valiant than anyone else but for the strange feat he possessed the javelin of c chulainn then the men of ireland sent redg medbs satirist to ask for the javelin redg asked for the javelin and c chulainn did not give it at once to him that is he was reluctant to give it redg threatened to deprive c chulainn of his honour then c chulainn cast the javelin after him and it lighted on the hollow at the back of his head and passed through his mouth out on to the ground and he managed to speak only the word: quickly did we get this treasure when his soul parted from his body on  p  line  the ford and since then that ford is called th solomshet and the bronze from the spear landed on the stream whence is the name umanshruth ever since the men of ireland debated as to which of them should attack c chulainn and they all agreed that cr mac da lth would be the right man to attack him for such was cr that it was not pleasant to be his bedfellow or to be intimate with him and they said that if it were cr who fell it would mean a lightening of oppression for the hosts and that if it were c chulainn it would be still better cr was summoned to medbs tent what do they want of me asked cr to attack c chulainn said medb ye think little of our valour ye think it wonderful when ye match me with a tender stripling such as he had i myself known why i was summoned i should not have come for that i should think it enough that a lad of his own age from among my household should go to oppose him on the ford nay it is foolish  to say that said cormac cond longas mac conchobuir it would be a fine thing for you yourself were c chulainn to fall by you make ye ready a journey for me in the early morning tomorrow for i am glad to go it is not the killing of yonder deer c chulainn that will cause you any delay early on the morrow then cr mac da lth arose a cartload of arms was brought by him to attack c chulainn and he began to try and kill him early on that day c chulainn betook himself to his feats these are all their names:  uballchless fenchless cless cletnech tetchless corpchless cless cait ch nerrid cor ndelend leim dar neim filliud eirred nir gai bulga ba brassi rothchless cles for anlaib brud gine san curad beim co fommus tthbeim reim fri fogaist drgud cretti fora rind fornaidm nad  it is impossible to translate most of these with any certainty as to the meaning  c chulainn used to practice each of these feats early every morning in one hand as swiftly as a cat makes for cream  that he might not forget or disremember them mac da lth remained for a third of the day behind the boss of his shield endeavouring to wound c chulainn then said leg to c chulainn: good now little c answer the warrior who seeks to kill you then c chulainn looked at him and raised up and cast aloft the eight balls and he made a cast of the ninth  p  line  ball at cr mac da lth so that it landed on the flat of his shield and the flat of his forehead and took a portion of brain the size of the ball out through the back of his head thus cr mac da lth fell by the hand of c chulainn if your securities and guarantees now bind you said fergus send another warrior to meet yon man at the ford or else remain here in your camp until the bright hour of sunrise tomorrow for cr mac da lth has fallen considering why we have come said medb it is all the same to us if we remain in the same tents they remained in that encampment until there had fallen cr mac da lth and lath mac da bro and srub daire mac fedaig and mac teora naignech those men fell by c chulainn in single combat but it is tedious to relate the prowess of each man separately  then c chulainn said to leg his charioteer: go friend leg to the encampment of the men of ireland and take a greeting from me to my friends and my fosterbrothers and my coevals take a greeting to fer diad mac damin and to fer det mac damin and to bress mac firb to lugaid mac nis and to lugaid mac solamaig to fer beth mac betin and to fer beth mac fir bend and take a special greeting to my fosterbrother lugaid mac nis for he is the only man who keeps faith and friendship with me now on the hosting and give him a blessing that he may tell you who comes to attack me tomorrow  then leg went forward to the encampment of the men of ireland and took a greeting to the friends and fosterbrothers of c chulainn and he went too into the tent of lugaid mac nis lugaid bade him welcome i trust that welcome said leg you may do so said lugaid i have come from c chulainn to speak with you said leg and he has sent you a true and sincere greeting and wishes you to tell me who comes to attack c chulainn today the curse of his intimacy and familiarity and friendship on him who comes it is his very own fosterbrother fer beth mac fir bend he was taken just now into medbs tent the girl findabair was placed at his side she it is who pours goblets for him she it is who kisses him at every drink she it is who serves him his meal not for all and sundry does medb intend the liquor which is served to fer beth for only fifty wagonloads of it were brought to the camp  p  line  then leg went back to c chulainn crestfallen sad joyless and mournful crestfallen sad joyless and mournful my friend leg comes to me said c chulainn it means that one of my fosterbrothers comes to attack mefor c chulainn disliked more that a warrior of the same training as himself should come to him rather than some other warriorgood now friend leg said c chulainn who comes to attack me today the curse of his intimacy and brotherhood of his familiarity and friendship be upon him it is your very fosterbrother fer beth mac fir bend he was taken just now into medbs tent the girl was placed at his side and it is she who pours goblets for him it is she who kisses him with every drink it is she who serves his meal not for all and sundry does medb intend the liquor which is served to fer beth only fifty wagonloads of it were brought to the camp  fer beth waited not until morning but went at once to renounce his friendship with c chulainn c chulainn adjured him by their friendship and intimacy and brotherhood but fer beth did not consent to relinquish the combat c chulainn left him in anger and trampled a sharp shoot of holly into the sole of his foot so that it injured alike flesh and bone and skin c chulainn tore out the holly shoot by the roots and cast it over his shoulder after fer beth and he cared not whether it reached him or not the holly shoot hit fer beth in the depression at the nape of his neck and went out through his mouth on to the ground and thus fer beth died that was indeed a good cast forcherd little c said fiacha mac fir aba for he considered it a good cast to kill the warrior with the holly shoot whence is still the name focherd muirtheimne for the spot where they were  go friend leg said c chulainn and speak with lugaid in the camp of the men of ireland and find out whether anything has happened to fer beth or not  the matter here added is a translation of the text in st lines  to supply what is lost in a wholepage lacuna in ll  and ask him who will come against me tomorrow leg goes forward to lugaids tent lugaid welcomed him i trust that welcome said leg you may trust it said lugaid i have come to speak with you on behalf of your fosterbrother that you may tell me if fer beth reached the camp he did said lugaid and a blessing on the hand that smote him for he fell dead in the glen a short time p  line  ago tell me who will come tomorrow to fight against c chulainn they are asking a brother of mine to oppose him a foolish youth proud and arrogant but a strong smiter and a victorious fighter and the reason he is sent to fight him is that he may fall by c chulainn and that i might then go to avenge his death on c chulainn but i shall never do that lirne mac  blaitmic is my brothers name i shall go to speak with c chulainn about that said lugaid his two horses were harnessed for lugaid and his chariot was yoked to them he came to meet c chulainn and a conversation took place between them then said lugaid: they are urging a brother of mine to come and fight with you a foolish youth rough uncouth but strong and stubborn and he is sent to fight you so that when he falls by you i may go to avenge his death on you but i shall never do so and by the friendship that is between us both do not kill my brother yet i swear that even if you all but kill him i grant you leave to do so for it is in despite of me that he goes against you then c chulainn went back and lugaid went to the camp then lirne mac nis was summoned to the tent of ailill and medb and finnabair was placed beside him it was she who used to serve him goblets and she who used to kiss him at every drink and she who used to hand him his food not to all and sundry does medb give the liquor that is served to fer beth or to lirne said finnabair she brought only fifty wagonloads of it to the camp whom do you mean asked ailill i mean that man yonder said she who is he asked ailill often you paid attention to something that was not certain it were more fitting for you to bestow attention on the couple who are best in wealth and honour and dignity of all those in ireland namely finnabair and lirne mac nis that is how i see them said ailill then in his joy lirne flung himself about so that the seams of the flockbeds under him burst and the green before the camp was strewn with their feathers  lirne longed for the full light of day that he might attack c chulainn he came in the early morning on the morrow and brought with him a wagonload of weapons and he came on to the ford to encounter c chulainn the mighty warriors in the camp did not think it worth their while to go and watch lirnes fight but the women and boys and girls scoffed and jeered at his fight c chulainn came to the ford to encounter lirne but he scorned to bring any weapons and came unarmed to meet him he struck all lirnes weapons out of his hand as one might deprive  p  line  a little boy of his playthings then c chulainn ground and squeezed in between his hands chastised him and clasped him crushed him and shook him and forced all his excrement out of him until a mist arose on all sides in the place where he was and after that he cast him from him from the bed of the ford across the camp to the entrance of his brothers tent however lirne never after rose without complaint and he never ate without pain and from that time forth he was never without abdominal weakness and constriction of the chest and cramps and diarrhoea he was indeed the only man who survived battle with c chulainn on the foray of cailnge yet the aftereffects of those complaints affected him so that he died later that is the fight of lirne on the foray of cailnge  then lch mr mac mo febis was summoned to the tent of ailill and medb what would ye with me asked lch that you should fight with c chulainn answered medb i shall not go on such an errand for i deem it no honour to attack a youthful beardless stripling and i do not intend that as an insult to him but i have the man to attack him namely long mac emonis and he will accept reward from you long was summoned to the tent of ailill and medb and medb promised him great rewards to wit the clothing of twelve men in garments of every colour a chariot worth four times seven cumala finnabair as his wedded wife and entertainment at all times in crachu with wine served to him then long came to meet c chulainn and c chulainn killed him  medb told her womenfolk to go and speak to c chulainn and tell him to put on a false beard of blackberry juice the women came forward towards c chulainn and told him to put on a false beard for no great warrior in the camp thinks it worth his while to go and fight with you while you are beardless after that c chulainn put on a beard of blackberry juice and came on to the hillock above the men of ireland and displayed that beard to all of them in general  lch mac mo febis saw this and said that is a beard on c chulainn that is what i see said medb she promised the same rewards to lch for checking c chulainn i shall go and attack him said lch  lch came to attack c chulainn and they met on the ford where long had fallen come forward to the upper ford said  p  line  lch for we shall not fight on this one for he held unclean the ford at which his brother had fallen then they met on the upper ford it was at that time that the morrgan daughter of ernmas from the fairymounds came to destroy c chulainn for she had vowed on the foray of regamain that she would come and destroy c chulainn when he was fighting with a mighty warrior on the foray of cailnge so the morrgan came there in the guise of a white redeared heifer accompanied by fifty heifers each pair linked together with a chain of white bronze the womenfolk put c chulainn under tabus and prohibitions not to let the morrgan go from him without checking and destroying her c chulainn made a cast at the morrgan and shattered one of her eyes then the morrgan appeared in the form of a slippery black eel swimming downstream and went into the pool and coiled herself around c chulainns legs while c chulainn was disentangling himself from her lch dealt him a wound crosswise through his chest then the morrgan came in the guise of a shaggy russetcoloured shewolf while c chulainn was warding her off lch wounded him thereupon c chulainn was filled with rage and wounded lch with the ga bulga and pierced his heart in his breast grant me a favour now c chulainn said lch what favour do you ask no favour of quarter do i ask nor do i make a cowardly request said lch retreat a step from me so that i may fall facing the east and not to the west towards the men of ireland lest one of them say that i fled in rout before you for i have fallen by the ga bulga i shall retreat said c chulainn for it is a warriors request you make and c chulainn retreated a step from him hence the ford has since then been known as th traiged at the end of tr mr  c chulainn was seized by great depression that day for that he fought singlehanded on the foray of cailnge and he ordered his charioteer leg to go to the men of ulster and bid them come to defend their cattle and great dejection and weariness took possession of c chulainn  and  chulainn translating st  and he uttered these verses: p  line  c chulainn   go forth from me o leg let the hosts be roused tell them for me in strong emain that each day in battle i am weary and i am wounded and bloody   my right side and my lefthard to appraise either of them it was no physicians hand which smote them gap:

with c chulainn on the foray of cailnge  then medb sent forth six together to attack c chulainn to wit traig and dorn and dernu col and accuis and erase three druids and three druidesses c chulainn attacked them and they fell by him since the terms of fair play and single combat had been broken against c chulainn he took his sling and began to shoot at the host that day northwards from delga though the men of ireland were numerous that day not one of them could turn southwards neither hound nor horse nor man  then came the morrgu daughter of ernmas from the elfmounds in the guise of an old woman and in c chulainns presence she  p  line  milked a cow with three teats the reason she came thus was to be succoured by c chulainn for no one whom c chulainn had wounded ever recovered until he himself had aided in his cure maddened by thirst c chulainn asked her for milk she gave him the milk of one teat may this be swiftly wholeness for me the one eye of the queen which had been wounded was cured c chulainn asked her for the milk of another teat she gave it to him swiftly may she be cured who gave it he asked for the third drink and she gave him the milk of the third teat the blessing of gods and nongods be on you womanthe magicians were their gods and the husbandmen were their nongodsand the queen was made whole then medb sent a hundred men together to assail c chulainn c chulainn attacked them all and they fell by his hand it is a hateful thing for us that our people should be slaughtered thus said medb that was not the first hateful thing that came to us from that man said ailill hence cuillend cind dne is still the name of the place where they were then and th cr is the name of the ford by which they were and rightly so because of the great amount of their blood and gore which flowed with the current of the river  breslech maige muirthemne the four provinces of ireland pitched their camp at the place called breslech mr in mag muirtheimne they sent their share of the cattle and booty on ahead southwards to clithar b ulad c chulainn took his post at ferta i l lergaib close beside them and his charioteer leg mac riangabra kindled a fire for him on the evening of that night c chulainn saw far off over the heads of the four great provinces of ireland the fiery glitter of the bright gold weapons at the setting of the sun in the clouds of evening anger and rage filled him when he saw the host because of the multitude of his foes and the great number of his enemies he seized his two spears and his shield and his sword he shook his shield and brandished his spears and waved his sword and he uttered a heros shout from his throat and the goblins and sprites and spectres of the glen and demons of the air gave answer for terror of the shout that he had uttered  he had uttered following st   and nemain the war p  line  goddess brought confusion on the host the four provinces of ireland made a clangour of arms around the points of their own spears and weapons and a hundred warriors of them fell dead that night of terror and fright in the middle of the encampment as leg was there he saw something: a single man coming straight towards him from the northeast across the camp of the four great provinces a single man approaches now little c said leg what manner of man is there said c chulainn an easy question: a man fair and tall with his hair cut broad curly yellow hair he has a green mantle wrapped about him with a brooch of white silver in the mantle above his breast he wears a tunic of royal satin with red insertion of red gold next to his white skin and reaching to his knees he carries a black shield with a hard boss of white bronze in his hand a fivepointed spear and beside it a forked javelin wonderful is the play and sport and diversion he makes with these weapons but none accosts him and he accosts none as if no one in the camp of the four great provinces of ireland saw him that is true my fosterling said he that is one of my friends from the fairy mounds coming to commiserate with me for they know of my sore distress as i stand alone now against the four great provinces of ireland on the foray of cailnge it was indeed as c chulainn said when the warrior came to where c chulainn was he spoke to him and commiserated with him sleep now for a little while c chulainn said the warrior your heavy slumber at the ferta in lerga till the end of three days and three nights and for that space of time i shall fight against the hosts  then c chulainn slept his deep slumber at the ferta in lerga till the end of three days and three nights it was right that the length of the sleep should correspond to the greatness of his weariness for from the monday before samain exactly until the wednesday after the festival of spring c chulainn had not slept in that time except when he dozed for a little while leaning against his spear after midday with his head on his clenched fist and his clenched fist about his spear and his spear resting on his knee but he was striking and cutting down and slaying and killing the four great provinces of ireland during that time then the warrior put plants from the sd and healing herbs and a curing charm into the wounds and cuts and gashes and many injuries of c chulainn so that c chulainn recovered in his sleep without his perceiving it at all  p  line  it was at this time that the youths came southwards from emain macha thrice fifty of the kings sons of ulster together with follomain mac conchobuir and they gave battle thrice to the hosts and three times their own number fell by them but the youths fell too all except follomain mac conchobuir follomain vowed that he would never go back to emain until he should take with him ailills head and the golden diadem that was on it that was no easy thing for him for the two sons of beithe mac bin the two sons of ailills fostermother and fosterfather came up with him and wounded him so that he fell by them that is the death of the youths from ulster and of follomain mac conchobuir  c chulainn however was in his deep sleep at ferta in lerga till the end of three days and three nights he arose then from his sleep and passed his hand over his face and he blushed crimson from head to foot and his spirit was strengthened as if he were going to an assembly or a march or a tryst or a feast or to one of the chief assemblies of ireland how long have i been now in this sleep warrior woe is me said c chulainn why is that said the warrior because the hosts have been left without attack for that space of time said c chulainn they have not so been left indeed said the warrior tell me who has attacked them said c chulainn the youths came from the north from emain macha thrice fifty of the kings sons of ulster led by follomain mac conchobuir and thrice they gave battle to the hosts in the space of the three days and three nights when you were asleep and three times their own number fell by them and all the youths fell too except for follomain mac conchobuir follomain vowed etc alas that i was not in my full strength for had i been the youths would not have fallen as they did nor would follomain have fallen  strive on little hound it is no reproach to your honour and no disgrace to your valour stay here for us tonight o warrior said c chulainn that we may together avenge the youths on the hosts i shall not stay indeed said the warrior for though a man do many valourous and heroic deeds in your company not he but you will have the fame or the reputation of them therefore i shall not stay but exert your valour yourself alone on the hosts for not with them lies any power over your life at this time  the scythed chariot my friend leg said c chulainn can you yoke it if you can yoke it and have its equipment then yoke it but if you have not its equipment do not yoke it  p  then the charioteer arose and put on his heros outfit for chariotdriving of the outfit for chariotdriving which he put on was his smooth tunic of skins which was light and airy supple and of fine texture stitched and of deerskin which did not hinder the movements of his arms outside over that he put on his outer mantle black as ravens featherssimon magus had made it for the king of the romans and darius gave it to conchobor and conchobor gave it to c chulainn who gave it to his charioteer the same charioteer now put on his helmet crested flatsurfaced fourcornered with variety of every colour and form and reaching past the middle of his shoulders this was an adornment to him and was not an encumbrance his hand brought to his brow the circlet of redyellow like a redgold plate of refined gold smelted over the edge of an anvil as a sign of his charioteering to distinguish him from his master in his right hand he took the long spancel of his horses and his ornamented goad in his left he grasped the thongs to check his horses that is the reins of his horses to control his driving  then he put on his horses the iron inlaid breastplates which covered them from forehead to forehand set with little spears and sharp points and lances and hard points so that every wheel of the chariot was closely studded with points and every corner and edge every end and front of that chariot lacerated in its passage then he cast a spell of protection over his horses and over his companion so that they were not visible to anyone in the camp yet everyone in the camp was visible to them it was right that he should cast this spell for on that day the charioteer had three great gifts of charioteering to wit leim dar boilg foscul ndriuch and immorchor ndelind  then the champion and warrior the marshalled fence of battle of all the men of earth who was c chulainn put on his battlearray of fighting and contest and strife which he put on were the twentyseven tunics worn next to his skin waxed board like compact which were bound with strings and ropes and thongs close to his fair skin that his mind and understanding might not be deranged when his rage should come upon him over that outside he put his heros battlegirdle of hard leather tough and tanned made from the best part of seven oxhides of yearlings which covered him from the thin part of his side to the thick part of his armpit he used to wear it to repel spears and points and darts and lances and arrows for they glanced from it as it they had struck against  p  line  stone or rock or hornthen he put on his apron of filmy silk with its border of variegated white gold against the soft lower part of his body outside his apron of filmy silk he put on his dark apron of pliable brown leather made from the choicest part of four yearling oxhides with his battlegirdle of cows skin about it then the royal hero took up his weapons of battle and contest and strife of these weapons of battle were these: he took his ivoryhilted brightfaced sword with his eight little swords he took his fivepronged spear with his eight little spears he took his javelin with his eight little javelins he took his deil chliss with his eight little darts he took his eight shields with his curved darkred shield into the boss of which a showboar could fit with its very sharp razorlike keen rim all around it which would cut a hair against the stream so sharp and razorlike and keen it was when the warrior did the edgefeat with it he would cut alike with his shield or his spear or his sword then he put on his head his crested war helmet of battle and strife and conflict from which was uttered the shout of a hundred warriors with a longdrawnout cry from every corner and angle of it for there used to cry from it alike goblins and sprites spirits of the glen and demons of the air before him and above him and around him wherever he went prophesying the shedding of the blood of warriors and champions there was cast over him his protective dress of raiment from tr tairngire brought to him from manannn mac lir from the king of tr na sorcha then his first distortion came upon c chulainn so that he became horrible manyshaped strange and unrecognisable his haunches shook about him like a tree in a current or a bulrush against a stream every limb and every joint every end and every member of him from head to foot he performed a wild feat of contortion with his body inside his skin his feet and his shins and his knees came to the back his heels and his calves and his hams came to the front the sinews of his calves came on the front of his shins and each huge round knot of them was as big as a warriors fist the sinews of his head were stretched to the nape of his neck and every huge immeasurable vast incalculable round ball of them was as big as the head of a monthold child  then his face became a red hollow  he sucked one of his eyes into his head so that a wild crane could hardly have reached it to pluck it out from the back of his skull on to the middle of his cheek the other eye sprang out on to his cheek his mouth was twisted back fearsomely he drew the cheek back from the  p  line  jawbone until his inner gullet was seen his lungs and his liver fluttered in his mouth and his throat he struck a lions blow with the upper palate on its fellow on its fellow translating st  so that every stream of fiery flakes which came into his mouth from his throat was as large as the skin of a threeyearold sheep the loud beating of his heart against his ribs was heard like the baying of a bloodhound gap: two words untranslatedextent:  words or like a lion attacking bears the torches of the wargoddess the virulent rainclouds the sparks of blazing fire were seen in the clouds and in the air above his head with the seething of fierce rage that rose above him his hair curled about his head like branches of red hawthorn used to refence the gap in a hedge though a noble appletree weighed down with fruit had been shaken about his hair scarcely one apple would have reached the ground through it but an apple would have stayed impaled on each single hair because of the fierce bristling of his hair above him the heros light rose from his forehead so that it was as long and as thick as a heros whetstone as high as thick as strong as powerful and as long as the mast of a great ship was the straight stream of dark blood which rose up from the very top of his head and became a dark magical mist like the smoke of a palace when a king comes to be attended to in the evening of a wintry day after c chulainn had been thus distorted the hero sprang into his scythed chariot with its iron points its thin sharp edges its hooks its steel points with its sharp spikes of a hero its arrangement for opening with its nails that were on the shafts and thongs and loops and fastenings in that chariot  then he performs the thunderfeat of a hundred and the thunderfeat of two hundred and the thunderfeat of three hundred and the thunderfeat of four hundred and he stopped at the thunderfeat of five hundred for he thought that at least that number should fall by him in his first attack and in his first contest of battle against the four provinces of ireland and he came forth in this manner to attack his enemies and took his chariot in a wide circuit outside the four great provinces of ireland and he drove the chariot heavily the iron wheels of the chariot sank deep into the ground so that the manner in which they sank into the ground left furrows sufficient to provide fort and fortress for there arose on the outside as high as the iron wheels dikes and boulders and rocks and flagstones and gravel from the ground  p  line  the reason why he made this warlike encircling of the four great provinces of ireland was that they might not flee from him and that they might not disperse around him until he took revenge on them by thus pressing them  for the wrong done to the youths of ulster and he came across into the middle of the ranks and threw up great ramparts of his enemies corpses outside around the host and he made the attack of a foe upon foes among them so that they fell sole of foot to sole of foot and headless neck to headless neck such was the density of their corpses thrice again he went around them in this way so that he left a layer of six around them that is the soles of three men to the necks of three men all around the encampment so that the name of this tale in the tin is sesrech breslige and it is one of the three slaughters which cannot be numbered in the foray the three being sesrech breslige and imslige glennamnach and the battle at girech and irgirech except that on this occasion hound and horse and man suffered alike others say that lug mac eithlend fought along with c chulainn at sesrech breslige their number is not known nor is it possible to count how many fell there of the common soldiery but their chiefs alone have been counted here follow their names: two men called cruaid two called calad two called cr two called car two called eicell three called cromm three called cur three called combirge four called feochar four called furachar four called cas four called fota five called caur five called cerman five called cobthach six called saxan six called dauith six called dire seven called rochaid seven called rnn seven called rurthech eight called rochlad eight called rochtad eight called rinnach eight called mulach nine called daigith nine called dire nine called damach ten called fiac ten called fiacha ten called feidlimid ten and six score kings did c chulainn slay in the breslech mr in mag muirtheimne and a countless number besides of hounds and horses and women and boys and children and the common folk for not one man in three of the men of ireland escaped without his thighbone or the side of his head or one eye being broken or without being marked for life  c chulainn came on the morrow to survey the host and to display his gentle beautiful appearance to women and girls and maidens to poets and men of art for he held not as honour or dignity the dark form of wizardry in which he had appeared to  p  line  them the previous night therefore he came on that day to display his gentle beautiful appearance beautiful indeed was the youth who came thus to display his form to the hosts c chulainn mac sualtaim three kinds of hair he had dark next to the skin bloodred in the middle and hair like a crown of redgold covering them fair was the arrangement of that hair with three coils in the hollow at the back of his head and like gold thread was every fine hair looseflowing golden and excellent long tressed distinguished and of beautiful colour as it fell back over his shoulders a hundred bright crimson twists of redgold redflaming about his neck a hundred strings with mixed carbuncles around his head four dimples in each of his two cheeks a yellow dimple and a green a blue dimple and a purple seven gems of brilliance of an eye in each of his royal eyes seven toes on each of his feet seven fingers on each of his hands with the grasp of a hawks claws and the grip of a hedgehogs claws in every separate on of them  then he puts on his dress for assembly that day of that raiment was a fair mantle wellfitting purple fringed five folded a white brooch of white silver inset with inlaid gold over his white breast as it were a bright lantern that mens eyes could not look at for its brilliance and splendour a tunic of silk next to his skin bordered with edges and braidings and fringes of gold and of silver and of white bronze reaching to the top of his dark apron darkred soldierly of royal satin a splendid darkpurple shield he bore with a rim of pure white silver around it he wore a goldenhilted ornamented sword at his left side in the chariot beside him was a long greyedged spear together with a sharp attacking dagger with splendid thongs and rivets of white bronze he held nine heads in one hand and ten in the other and these he brandished at the hosts in token of his valour and prowess medb hid her face beneath a shelter of shields lest c chulainn should cast at her on that day  then the women begged the men of ireland to lift them up on platforms of shields above the warriors shoulders that they might see c chulainns appearance for they wondered at the beautiful gentle appearance they beheld on him that day compared with the dark buffoonlike shape of magic that had been seen on him the night before  then dubthach del ulad was seized with envy and spite and great jealousy concerning his wife and he advised the hosts to  p  line  betray and abandon c chulainn that is to lay an ambush around him on every side that he might be killed by them and he spoke these words: dubthach del ulad   if this is the distorted one there will be corpses of men because of him there will be cries around courts mens feet will be gap: text untranslatedextent:  word ravens shall eat ravens food   stones shall be erected over graves because of him there will be increase of kingly slaughter unlucky are ye that battle with the wild one reached you on the slope   i see the wild ones form nine heads he carries among his cushions  among his cushions translating lu  i see the shattered spoils he brings and ten heads as treasured triumph  i see how your womenfolk raise their heads above the battle i see your great queen who comes not to the fight   if i were your counsellor warriors would be in ambush on all sides that they might shorten his life if this is the distorted one  fergus mac fig heard this and it grieved him that dubthach should advise the hosts to betray c chulainn and he gave dubthach a strong and violent kick so that he fell on his face outside the group and fergus brought up against him all the wrongs and injustice and treachery and evil deeds that he had ever at any time done to the men of ulster and he spoke these words then:  fergus  if it is dubthach deltenga he draws back in the rear of the host he has done nothing good since he slaughtered the womenfolk  he performed an infamous and terrible deed of violencethe slaying of fiacha mac conchobuir nor was fairer another deed that was heard of himthe slaying of cairbre mac fedlimthe  p  line  it is not for the lordship of ulster that the son of lugaid mac casruba contends this is how he treats men: those he cannot kill he sets at loggerheads  ulsters exiles do not wish that their beardless boy should be killed if the men of ulster come to you they will turn back your herds  all your cattle will be driven afar before the ulstermen if they rise from their sickness there will be deeds of violencemighty tales and queens will be tearful  mens corpses will be trampled underfoot mens feet will be in ravens abode  shields will lie flat on the slopes furious deeds will increase  i see that your womenfolk have raised their heads above the battle i see your great queenshe comes not to the combat  the unvalorous son of lugaid will not do any brave or generous deed no king will see lances redden if this is dubthach deltenga  thus far the scythed chariot  then a bold warrior of the ulstermen called engus mac enlime gbe came up with the hosts and he drove them before him from moda loga which is now called lugmud to th da fhert on slab fait learned men say that if they had come to engus mac enlimne gbe in single combat they would have fallen by his hand however that it is not what they did but an ambush was made around him on every side and he fell by them at th da fhert on slab fait  here now is the tale imroll belaig ein then came to them fiacha faldna of the ulstermen to have speech with the son of his mothers sister namely mane ande of the connachtmen and he came accompanied by dubthach del  p  line  ulad mane ande moreover came accompanied by dche mac mgach when dche mac mgach saw fiacha faldna he cast a spear at him straightaway and it went through his own friend dubthach del ulad fiacha cast a spear at dcha mac mgach and it went through his own kinsman maine ande of the connachtmen then said the men of ireland: a badly aimed cast said they was what befell the men each of them wounding his own friend and relation so that is the miscast at belach ein and another name for it is another miscast at belach ein here now is the tale tuige im thamon then the men of ireland told tamon the jester to put on ailills garments and his golden crown and to go on the ford in front of them so he put on ailills garments and his golden crown and came on the ford in front of them the men of ireland began to scoff and shout and jeer at him it is the covering of a stump tamon for you tamon the jester said they to put on you ailills garments and his golden crown so that story is called tuige in thamon the covering of a stump c chulainn saw tamon and it seemed to him in his ignorance and want of information that it was ailill himself who was there and he cast a stone at him from his sling and killed him on the ford where he was  so that the place is th tamuin and the story is called tuige im thamon  the four great provinces of ireland encamped at the pillar stone in crch roiss that night then medb asked the men of ireland for one of them to fight and do battle with c chulainn on the morrow every man of them kept saying: it will not be i who go it will not be i who leave my place no captive is owing from my people  then medb asked fergus to go to fight with and encounter c chulainn since she was unable to get the men of ireland to do so it would not be fitting for me said fergus to encounter a young and beardless lad my own fosterling however when medb begged fergus so urgently he was unable not to undertake the fight they remained there that night fergus rose early on the morrow and came forward to the ford of combat where c chulainn was c chulainn saw him coming towards him  p  line  with weak security does my master fergus come to me he has no sword in the sheath of the great scabbard c chulainn spoke trulya year before these event ailill had come upon fergus together with medb on the hillside in crachu with his sword on the hill beside him and ailill had snatched the sword from its sheath and put a wooden sword in its place and he swore that he would not give him back the sword until he gave it on the day of the great battlei care not at all my fosterling said fergus for even if there were a sword in it it would not reach you and would not be wielded against you but for the sake of the honour and nurture i and the ulstermen and conchobor gave you flee before me today in the presence of the men of ireland i am loath to do that said c chulainn to flee before one man on the foray of cailnge you need not shrink from doing so said fergus for i shall flee before you when you shall be covered with wounds and blood and pierced with stabs in the battle of the tin and when i alone shall flee then all the men of ireland will flee so eager was c chulainn to do whatever was for ulsters weal that his chariot was brought to him and he mounted it and fled in rout from the men of ireland the men of ireland saw that he has fled from you he has fled from you fergus said all pursue him pursue him fergus said medb let him not escape from you not so indeed said fergus i shall not pursue him any farther for though ye may belittle that flight i put him to yet of all who encountered him on the foray of cailnge not one man of the men of ireland did as much so i shall not meet that man again until the men of ireland meet him in turn in single combat that is called the encounter of fergus  here now is the story cinnit ferchon ferch loingsech was of the connachtmen he was engaged in fighting and harassing ailill and medb from the day these assumed rule he came not to their encampment on expedition or hosting in straits or need or hardship but spent his time plundering and pillaging their borders and lands behind their backs at that time he happened to be in the eastern part of mag na twelve men was the number of his band he was told that one man had been holding back and checking the four great provinces of ireland  p  line  from the monday at the beginning of samain until the beginning of spring slaying one man of their number at a ford every day and a hundred warriors every night ferch took counsel with his men what better plan could we carry out said he than to go and attack yonder man who is checking and holding back the four great provinces of ireland and to bring back with us his head in triumph to ailill and medb though we have done many wrongs and injuries to ailill and to medb we shall obtain peace thereby if that man fall by us that is the plan they decided on and they came forward to the place where c chulainn was and when they came they did not grant him fair play or single combat but all twelve of them attacked him straightaway however c chulainn fell upon them and forthwith struck off their twelve heads and he planted twelve stones for them in the ground and put a head of each one of them on its stone and also put ferch loingsechs head on its stone so that the spot where ferch loingsech left his head is called cinnit ferchon that is cennit ferchon the headplace of ferch then the men of ireland debated as to whom they should send to fight and do combat with c chulainn at the hour of early morning on the morrow they all agreed that it should be calatn dna with his twentyseven sons and his grandson glas mac delga now there was poison on each man of them and poison on each weapon that they carried none of them ever missed a throw and anyone whom one of them wounded if he died not at once would die before the end of nine days great rewards were promised them for this fight and they undertook to engage in it this agreement was made in the presence of fergus but he was unable to dispute it for they said that they counted it as single combat that calatn dna and his twentyseven sons and his grandson glas mac delga should all engage in the fight for they asserted that his son was but one of his limbs and one of his parts and that the issue of his own body belonged to calatn dna  fergus came forward to his tent and followers and heaved a sigh of weariness we are sad for the deed to be done to morrow said fergus what deed is that asked his followers the killing of c chulainn said he alas said they who kills him calatn dna said he with his twenty seven sons and his grandson glas mac delga there is poison on every man of them and poison on each of their weapons and there is none  p  line  whom one of them wounds but dies before the end of nine days if he do not die at once and there is not man who should go to witness the encounter for me and bring me news if c chulainn should be killed to whom i would not give my blessing and my gear i shall go there said fiachu mac fir aba they remained there that night early on the morrow calatn dna arose with his twentyseven sons and his grandson glas mac delga and they advanced to where c chulainn was and fiachu mac fir aba came too and when calatn reached the spot where c chulainn was they cast at him at once their twenty nine spears nor did a single spear miss its aim and go past c chulainn c chulainn performed the edgefeat with his shield and all the spears sank half their length into the shield not only was that not a misthrow for them but yet not a spear wounded him or drew blood then c chulainn drew his sword from its warlike scabbard to lop off the weapons and so to lessen the weight of his shield while he was so doing they went towards him and all together they smote his head with their twentynine clenched right fists they belaboured him and forced his head down so that his face and countenance met the gravel and sand of the ford c chulainn uttered his heros cry and the shout of one outnumbered and no ulsterman alive of those who were awake but heard him then fiachu mac fir aba came towards him and saw how matters were and he was filled with emotion on seeing a man of his own folk in danger he drew his sword from its warlike scabbard and dealt a blow which lopped off their twentynine fists at one stroke and they all fell backwards so intense was their effort so tight their grip c chulainn raised his head and drew his breath and gave a sight of weariness and then he saw the man who had come to his help it is timely aid my fosterbrother said c chulainn though it be timely aid for you it will not be so for us for though you think little of the blow i struck yet if it be discovered the three thousand men of the finest of clann rudraige that we number in the camp of the men of ireland will be put to the sword i swear said c chulainn now that i have raised my head and drawn my breath that unless you yourself make it known not one of those yonder shall tell of it henceforth then c chulainn fell upon them and began to strike them and to cut them down and he scattered them around him in small pieces and divided quarters east and west throughout the ford one of them glas mac delga escaped by taking to his heels while c chulainn was beheading the rest and c chulainn rushed after him and glas  p  line  came round the tent of ailill and medb and only managed to say fiach fiach when c chulainn struck him a blow and cut off his head they made quick work of yon man said medb what debt did he speak of fergus i do not know said fergus unless perhaps some one in the camp owed him debts and they were on his mind however said fergus it is a debt of flesh and blood for him i swear indeed said fergus that now all his debts have been paid in full to him  thus fell at c chulainn hands calatn dna and his twentyseven sons and his grandson glas mac derga and there still remains in the bed of the ford the stone around which they fought and struggled and on it the mark of their sword hilts and of their knees and elbows and of the hafts of their spears and the name of the ford is fuil iairn to the west of th fhir diad it is called fuil iairn because swords were bloodstained there  thus far the encounter with the sons of calatn  the encounter with fer diad then the men of ireland considered what man should be sent to fight with c chulainn in the hour of early morning on the morrow they all said that it should be fer diad mac damin meic dire the brave warrior from fir domnand for similar and equal was their power of fighting and combat with the same fostermothers scthach and athach and afe had they learnt the arts of valour and arms and neither of them had any advantage over the other save that c chulainn possessed the feat of the ga bulga however to counterbalance this fer diad had a hornskin when fighting with a warrior on the ford  then messengers and envoys were sent for fer diad fer diad refused and denied and again refused those messengers and he did not come with them for he knew what they wanted of him which was to fight with his friend and companion and fosterbrother c chulainn mac sualtaim and so he came not with them then medb sent the druids and satirists and harsh bands for fer diad that they might make against him three satires to stay him and three lampoons and that they might raise on his face three  p  line  blisters shame blemish and disgrace so that he might die before the end of nine days if he did not succumb at once unless he came with the messengers for the sake of his honour fer diad came with them for he deemed it better to fall by shafts of valour and prowess and bravery than by the shafts of satire and reviling and reproach and when he arrived he was greeted with honour and served and pleasanttasting intoxicating liquor was poured out for him until he was intoxicated and merry and great rewards were promised him for engaging in that fight namely a chariot worth four times seven cumala the equipment of twelve men in garments of every colour the equal of his own domains in the arable land of mag na freedom from tax and tribute from encampment and expedition and exaction for his son and his grandson and his greatgrandson to the end of time findabair as his wedded wife and in addition the golden brooch in medbs mantle as medb made these promises she spoke the following words and fer diad answered her:  medb  you shall have a reward of many bracelets and your share of plain and forest together with freedom for your posterity from today for ever o fer diad mac damin you shall have beyond all expectation  why should you not accept what others accept  fer diad  i shall not accept it without surety for no warrior without

it preferable fight with c chulainn alone and fer diad took sureties from her as he believed that she should send those six heroes to fulfil the conditions that had been promised to him if c chulainn were to fall at his hands then his horses were harnessed for fergus and his chariot yoked and he came forward to where c chulainn was that he might tell him how matters were c chulainn made him welcome welcome is your coming my master fergus said c chulainn i deem that welcome trustworthy my fosterling said fergus  p  line  but the reason i have come is to tell you who comes to meet you and fight with you at the hour of early morning tomorrow let us hear it from you then said c chulainn your own friend and companion and fosterbrother the man who is your equal in feats of arms and prowess and great deeds fer diad mac damin meic dire the brave warrior of fir domnand by my conscience said c chulainn it is not to encounter him we wish any friend of ours to come that is why said fergus you should be on your guard against him and prepare for him for not like the rest who encountered you and fought with you on the foray of cailnge at this time is fer diad mac damin meic dire i have been here however said c chulainn checking and holding back the four great provinces of ireland from the monday at the beginning of samain until the beginning of spring and in all that time i have not gone a step in retreat before a single man still less shall i retreat i think before this man and as fergus spoke thus putting him on his guard he said these words an c chulainn answered him: fergus   o c chulainnclear covenant i see that it is time for you to rise fer diad mac demin of the ruddy countenance comes here to meet you in his wrath  c chulainn   i am hereno easy taskstrongly holding back the men of ireland i never retreated a step to avoid encounter with a single opponent  fergus   fierce is the man who wreaks his anger with his blood red sword fer diad of the many followers has a hornskin against which no fight or combat can prevail  c chulainn   be silent argue not this matter o fergus of the mighty weapons over every land and territory there is not fight against odds for me  fergus   fierce is the manscores of deeds of valourit is not easy to overcome him there is the strength of a hundred in his body brave is the hero the points of weapons pierce him not the edge of weapons cuts him not  c chulainn   if i and fer diad of wellknown valour were to meet at a ford it would not be a fight without fierceness  our sword fight would be wrathful  p  line  fergus   i should prefer above reward o c chulainn of the red sword that you should be the one to take the spoils of proud fer diad eastwards  c chulainn   i vow and promise though i am not good in vaunting that i shall be the one to triumph over the son of damn mac dre  fergus   it was i who in requital for the wrong done me by ulstermen collected the forces from the east with me their heroes and warriors came from their own lands  c chulainn   were conchobor not in his debility the meeting would be hard medb of mag in scil has never come on a more uproarious march  fergus   a greater deed now awaits your handthe fight with fer diad mac damin have with you o c chulainn a weapon harsh and hard and famed in son  fergus came forward to the encampment fer diad went to his tent and his followers and told them how medb had obtained from him a covenant whereby he would fight and encounter six heroes on the morrow or else fight and encounter c chulainn alone if he should prefer he told them too that he had obtained from medb a covenant whereby she should send the same six heroes to fulfil the promises that had been made to him if c chulainn should fall by him  that night the men in fer diads tent were not cheerful tranquil joyful or merry but they were sad sorrowful and downhearted for they knew that when the two heroes the two battlebreaches of a hundred encountered each other one of them would fall or both would fall and if it were one of them they believed that it would be their own lord for no easy matter was it to fight and encounter c chulainn on the foray of cailnge  fer diad slept heavily at the beginning of the night and when the end of the night was come his sleep departed from him and his drunkenness left him and anxiety concerning the fight preyed upon him he ordered his charioteer to harness his horses and to yoke his chariot the charioteer began to dissuade him it were better for you to stay here than to go there said the driver hold  p  line  your peace lad said fer diad and as he spoke he said these words and the servant answered him: fer diad  let us go to this encounter to contend with this man until we reach the ford above which the wargoddess will shriek let us go to meet c chulainn to wound him through his slender body that a spearpoint may pierce him so that he may die thereof  charioteer  it were better for you to stay here no smooth speech will ye exchange there will be one to whom sorrow will come your fight will be short an encounter with a noble of the ulstermen is one from which harm will come long will it be remembered woe to him who goes on that course  fer diad  not right is what you say for diffidence is not the business of a warrior and we must not show timidity we shall not stay here for you be silent lad we shall presently be brave better is stoutness than cowardice let us go to the encounter  fer diads horses were harnessed and his chariot was yoked and he came forward to the ford of combat though as yet day with its full brightness had not come well lad said fer diad spread the coverings and rugs of my chariot beneath me that i may sleep a heavy fit of slumber here for i did not sleep during the last part of the night with anxiety about the fight the servant unharnessed the horses and unyoked the chariot and fer diad slept his heavy fit of slumber on it as for c chulainn now he rose not until day had dawned on him with its full brightness lest the men of ireland should say that it was fear or cowardice that caused him to do so if he rose early but when day came with its full brightness he bade his charioteer harness his horses and yoke his chariot good my lad said c chulainn harness our horses for us and yoke our chariot for an early riser is the warrior appointed to meet us namely fer diad mac damin meic dire the horses are harnessed the chariot is yoked mount the chariot then there is no reproach to your valour  then c chulainn mac sualtaim mounted his chariot the blowdealing featperforming battlewinning redsworded hero and  p  line  around him shrieked goblins and sprites and fiends of the glen and demons of the air for the tatha de danand used to raise a cry about him so that the fear and terror and horror and fright that he inspired might be all the greater in every battle and field of conflict and in every encounter to which he went not long was fer diads charioteer there when he heard something: a noise and a clamour and an uproar a tumult and thunder a din and a great sound namely the clash of shields the rattle of spears the mighty blows of swords the loud noise of helmet the clang of breastplate the friction of weapons the violence of feats of arms the straining of ropes the rumble of wheels and the creaking of the chariot the hoofbeats of the horses and the deep voice of the hero and warrior as he came to the ford to meet him  the servant came and laid his hand upon his master well fer diad said the servant arise for they are coming to you at the ford and the servant spoke these words:  charioteer   i hear the sound of a chariot with fair yoke of silver i perceive the form of a man of great size rising above the front of the strong chariot past bregros and past braine they advance along the road past the treestump at baile in bile victorious is their triumph   a clever hound drives a bright chariotfighter harnesses a noble hawk lashes his steeds towards the south bloodstained is the hound it is sure that he will come to us we knowlet there not be silence about itthat he comes to give us battle   woe to him who is on the hill awaiting the worthy hound last year i foretold that he would come at some time the hound of emain macha the hound with shape of every colour the hound of spoils the hound of battle i hear him and he hears us  well lad said fer diad why have you praised that man ever since you left your house it is almost a cause of strife that you should have praised him so highly but ailill and medb have prophesied to me that that man would fall by me and since is for reward he shall be destroyed shortly by me and now it is time for help and he spoke these words and the servant answered him:  p  line  fer diad   it is time now for help be silent do not praise him it was no deed of friendship for he is not doom over the brink  if you see the hero of cailnge with his proud feats since it is for reward he shall soon be destroyed  charioteer   if i see the hero of cailnge with his proud feats he does not flee from us but towards us he comes though skilful he is not grudging he runs and not slowly like water from a high cliff or like a swift thunderbolt  fer diad   so much have you praised him that it is almost a cause of a quarrel why have you chosen him since you came forth from your house now they appear now they are challenging him none come to attack him save cowardly churls  not long was fer diads charioteer there when he saw something: a beautiful fiveedged fourwheeled chariot approaching with strength and swiftness and skill with a green awning with a framework of narrow campact opening in which feats were exhibited a framework tall as a swordblade fit for heroic deeds behind two horses swift highspringing big eared beautiful bounding with flaring nostrils with broad chests with lively heart highgroined widehoofed slenderlegged mighty and violent in one shaft of the chariot was a grey horse broadthighed small stepping longmaned in the other shaft a black horse flowing maned swiftcoursing broadbacked like a hawk to its prey  on a day of harsh wind or like a gust of the stormy spring wind on a march day across a plain or like a furious stag newly roused by hounds in the first chaseso were the two horses of c chulainn in the chariot as if they were on a bright fiery flagstone so that they shook the earth and made it tremble with the speed of their course  c chulainn arrived at the ford fer diad remained on the southern side of the ford c chulainn stayed on the northern side fer diad made c chulainn welcome welcome is your coming c chulainn said fer diad until now i trusted that welcome said c chulainn but today i trust it no more and fer diad said c chulainn it were fitter that i should welcome you rather than that you should welcome me for it is you who have come to the country and province in which i dwell and it was not right for you to come and fight with me rather should i have gone to fight with you for driven before you are my womenfolk and youths  p  line  and boys my horses and steeds my droves and flocks and herds o c chulainn said fer diad what caused you to come and fight with me for when we were with scthach and athach and afe you were to me a servingman who used to prepare my spears and dress my couch that is true indeed said c chulainn because of my youth and lack of age i used to act thus for you but that is not how i am today indeed for there is not in the world a warrior whom i shall not drive off and then each of them reproached the other bitterly as they renounced their friendship and fer diad spoke these words and c chulainn answered him:  fer diad   what has led you little hound to fight with a strong champion your flesh  will be bloodred above the steam of your horses woe to him who comes as you do it will be as vain as the kindling of a fire from a single stick of firewood if you reach your home you will be in need of healing  c chulainn   i have come a wild boar of the herd before warriors before troops before hundreds to thrust you beneath the waters of the pool in anger against you and to prove you in a many sided encounter so that harm may come to you as you defend your life  fer diad   there is here on who will crush you it is i who will slay you for it is i who can the defeat of their hero in the presence of the ulstermen may it long be remembered may it be to them loss  c chulainn   how shall we meet shall we groan over corpses on what pool shall we fight as we meet on the ford shall it be with hard swords or with strong spearpoints that you will be slain before your hosts if the time has come  fer diad   before sunset before night if you are in straits you attack when you fight at bairche the battle will not be bloodless the ulstermen are calling you a cancer  has attacked them evil will be the sight for them they will be utterly defeated  p  line  c chulainn   you have come to the gap of danger the end of your life is at hand sharp weapons will be wielded on you it will be no gentle purpose it will be a great champion who will slay you we two shall meet you shall not be the leader of three men from now until doomsday  fer diad   leave off your warning you are the most boastful man on earth you shall have neither reward nor remission for you are no hero overtopping others i it is who know you you with the heart of a bird you are but a nervous lad without valour or force  c chulainn   when we were with scthach by dint of our usual valour we would fare forth together and traverse every land you were my loved comrade my kin and kindred never found i one dearer sad will be your death  fer diad   too much you neglect your honour that we may not do battle but before the cock crows your head will be impaled on a spit o c chulainn of cailnge frenzy and madness have seized you all evil shall come to you from us for yours is the guilt  well fer diad said c chulainn it was not right for you to come and fight with me by reason of the strife and dissension stirred up by ailill and medb and all who came thus got neither success or profit but they fell by me and neither shall you have success or profit from it and you will fall at my hands as he spoke he said these words and fer diad hearkened to him:  c chulainn  do not draw near me o valiant warrior fer diad son of damn you will fare the worse for it it will bring sorrow to many  by just truth come not near me for i am the one destined to bring you to your grave why was not my prowess directed solely against you  let not many feats overcome  you though you the hornskinned are bloodstained the maid of whom you boast will not be yours o son of damn  p  line  findabair the daughter of medb though great her beauty that maid though fair you shall not wed  findabair the kings daughter when the truth of the matter is told she played many men false she destroyed such as you  break not unknowing your oath to me break not compact break not friendship break not word an promise come not towards me o valiant warrior  to fifty warriors the maid was pledgeda wise pledge indeed their death came through me from me they got only justice dealt by a spear  though fierce and proud was fer beth with his household of goodly warriors yet i soon quelled his pride and slew him with one cast  bitter was the lessening of srubdaires valiant deeds srubdaire who was the darling of a hundred women once his renown was great but neither gold nor fine raiment saved him  if it were to me that she had been affianced the woman in whom all the fair province delights  in  delights reading c   i would not wound your breast in the south or in the north in the west or in the east fer diad said c chulainn that is why it was not right for you to come and fight with me for when we were with scthach and athach and afe we used to go together into every battle and field of contest into every fight and combat into every wood and wasteland every secret place and hidden spot and as he spoke he said these words: c chulainn  we were loving friends we were comrades in the wood we were men who shared a bed we would sleep a deep sleep after our weary fights in many strange lands together we would ride and range through every wood when we were taught by scthach  p  line  fer diad  o accomplished c chulainn said fer diad we have learnt the same art they have overcome the bonds of friendship your wounds have been paid for remember not our fosterage together o hound it is of not avail to you  too long have we been like this now said fer diad and what weapons shall we use today c chulainn yours is the choice of weapons until night today said c chulainn for you were the first to reach the ford do you remember at all said fer diad the choice feats of arms which we practised with scthach and athach and afe i remember them indeed said c chulainn if you do let us have recourse to them  they had recourse to their choicest feats of arms they put on two shields marked with emblems and took their eight ocharcles and their eight javelins and their eight ivoryhilted blades and their eight battledarts these would fly from them and to them like bees on a fine day they cast no weapon which found not its aim each of them began to cast these weapons at the other from the twilight of early morning until the middle of the day and they blunted their many weapons against the curved surfaces and bosses of the shields despite the excellence of the casting the defence was so good that neither of them wounded or drew blood from the other during that time let us lay aside these weapons now c chulainn said fer diad since not by them comes the decision between us let us do so indeed if the time has  p  line  come said c chulainn they ceased then and gave their weapons into the hands of their charioteers what weapons shall we use now c chulainn said fer diad yours is the choice of weapons until night said c chulainn since you were the first to reach the ford let us take then said fer diad to our polished sharpened hard smooth spears with their thongs of hard flax let us do so indeed said c chulainn then they took on them two hard equally strong shields and they had recourse to the polished sharpened hard smooth spears with their thongs of hard flax each of them fell to casting the spears at the other from the middle of the day till the evening despite the excellence of the defence so good was their mutual casting that during that time each of them bled and reddened and wounded the other let us cease from this now c chulainn said fer diad let us do so indeed if the time has come said c chulainn they ceased then and gave their weapons into the hands of their charioteers  then each of them went towards the other and put an arm around the others neck and kissed him thrice that night their horses were in one paddock and their charioteers at one fire and their charioteers made litterbeds of fresh rushers for them and on them pillows for wounded men then came folk of healing and curing to heal and cure them and they put herbs and healing plants and a curing charm into their wounds and cuts their gashes and many stabs of every herb and healing plant and curing charm which was applied to the wounds and cuts the gashes and many stabs of c chulainn an equal amount was sent westwards by him across the ford to fer diad lest the men of ireland should say if fer diad fell by him that it was because of the advantage c chulainn had over him in healing of every food and every palatable pleasant strong drink which was brought from the men of ireland to fer diad an equal portion was sent northwards from him across the ford to c chulainn for the purveyors of food to fer diad were more numerous than those of c chulainn all the men of ireland were purveyors of food to fer diad that he might ward off c chulainn from them the men of bregia were purveyors to c chulainn they used to come to him daily that is every night  they remained there that night they arose early on the morrow and came forward to the ford of combat what weapons shall we use today fer diad said c chulainn yours is the choice of weapons until night said fer diad since i had choice of weapons on the day that is past let us then said c chulainn take to our great long spears today for we think that thrusting with the spears today will bring us nearer to a decisive victory than the casting of missiles did yesterday let our horses be harnessed for us and our chariots yoked that we may fight from our horses and chariots today let us do so indeed said fer diad then they put on two broad strong shields that day they had recourse to the great long spears that day each of them began to pierce and wound to overthrow  and cast each other down  from the twilight of early morning until sunset if it were usual for birds in flight to pass through mens bodies they would have gone through their bodies that day and carried lumps of flesh and blood through their wounds and cuts into the clouds and the air outside and when evening came their horses were weary and their charioteers tired and the heroes and champions themselves were weary  p  line  too let us cease from this now fer diad said c chulainn for our horses are weary and our charioteers are tired and when they are weary why should we also not be weary and as he spoke he said these words: c chulainn   we are not bound to endure the swaying of the chariots said he straining against giants let their spancels be put on the horses for the noise of battle is over  let us cease indeed if the time for it has come said fer diad they ceased they gave over their weapons into the hands of their charioteers each of them came towards the other each put an arm around the otherss neck and kissed him thrice that night their horses were in one paddock their charioteers at one fire their charioteers made for them litterbeds of fresh rushers with the pillows of wounded men on them physicians and doctors came to examine and watch them and to attend on them that night for because of the dreadfulness of their wounds and gashes of their cuts and many stabs all they could do for them was to apply spells and incantations and charms to them to staunch the bleeding and haemorrhage and to keep the dressings in place of all the spells and incantations and charms which were applied to the wounds and gashes of c chulainn and equal portion was sent by him westwards across the ford to fer diad of all the food and palatable pleasant strong drink which was brought from the men of ireland to fer diad an equal amount was sent by him northwards across the ford to c chulainn for fer diads purveyors of food were more numerous than those of c chulainn as all the men of ireland were purveyors of food to fer diad for warding off c chulainn from them but only the men of bregia were purveyors of food to c chulainn they used to come and converse with him daily that is every night  they remained there that night they rose early on the morrow and came forward to the ford of combat c chulainn saw that fer diad had an ill and gloomy appearance on that day your appearance is not good today fer diad said c chulainn your hair has grown dark today and your eye dull and you are changed from your usual form and figure not because i fear or dread you am i thus today however said fer diad for there is not in ireland today a warrior i shall not repel and c chulainn was lamenting and pitying him and he spoke these words and fer diad answered:  p  line  c chulainn  o fer diad if this is you sure i am that you are one utterly doomed that you should come at a womans behest to fight with your fosterbrother  fer diad  o c chulainnwise fulfilmento great hero great warrior a man must make this journey to the sod whereon is his grave  c chulainn  findabair the daughter of medb however beautiful her form was given to you not for love of you but to prove your noble might  fer diad  my might is long since proven o hound of the gentle rule none braver has been heard of or found until today  c chulainn  you are the cause of all that happens o son of damn mac dire that you should come at womans behest to cross swords with your fosterbrother  fer diad  should i part from you without a fight o gentle hound though we are fosterbrothers my word and my name would be held in ill esteem by ailill and medb of crachu  c chulainn  he has not yet put food to his lips nor has he yet been born of king or bright queen for whom i would consent to do you harm  fer diad  o c chulainnmany deeds of valournot you but medb betrayed us you will have victory and fame not on you is our guilt  c chulainn  my brave heart is a clot of blood my life has almost left me no equal fight do i deem it to encounter you fer diad  however much you belittle me today said fer diad what weapons shall we use you have the choice of weapons until night today said c chulainn for it was i who chose them yesterday let us then said fer diad take our heavy hardsmiting swords today for we think that the mutual striking with swords today will bring us nearer to a decisive victory than did the thrusting with spears yesterday let us do so indeed  p  line  said c chulainn then they took up two great long shields that day they wielded their heavy hardsmiting swords each of them began to smite and hew to slaughter and slay each other and every portion and piece that each hacked from the shoulders and thighs and shoulderblades of the other was as big as the head of a monthold child each of them kept on smiting the other in this way from the twilight of early morning until evening let us cease from this now c chulainn said fer diad let us cease indeed if the time for it has come said c chulainn so they ceased and gave over their weapons into the hands of their charioteers though two cheerful tranquil happy and joyful men had met there their parting that night was the parting of two sad unhappy dispirited ones that night their horses were not in the same paddock nor their charioteers at the same fire they remained there that night then fer diad rose early on the morrow and came alone to the ford of combat for he knew that this was the decisive day of the fight and he knew too that one of them would fall in the fight that day or that both would fall then before c chulainn came to meet him he put on his battle equipment of that battle equipment was his filmy satin apron with its border of variegated gold which he wore next to his fair skin outside that he put on his apron of supple brown leather and outside that a great stone as big as a millstone and outside that stone through fear and dread of the ga bulga that day he put his strong deep iron apron made of smelted iron on his head he put his crested helmet of battle which was adorned with forty carbunclegems studded with red enamel and crystal and carbuncle and brilliant stones from the eastern world in his right hand he took his fierce strong spear he set at his left side his curved battlesword with its golden hilt and guards of red gold on the arching slope of his back he put his huge enormous fair shield with its fifty bosses into each boss of which a show boar could fit not to speak of the great central boss of red gold that day fer diad exhibited many and wonderful and brilliant feats of arms which he had not learned from anyone before that neither from fostermother nor fosterfather not from scthach nor athach nor afe but he invented them himself on that day to oppose c chulainn  c chulainn too came to the ford and he saw the many brilliant wonderful feats of arms performed by fer diad you see yonder my friend leg the many brilliant wonderful feats performed by fer diad and in due course now all those feats will be directed  p  line  against me therefore if it be i who am defeated this day you must incite me and revile me and speak evil of me so that my ire and anger shall rise the higher thereby but if it be i who inflict defeat you must exhort me and praise me and speak will of me that thereby my courage rise higher it shall so be done indeed little c said leg then c chulainn too put on his battleequipment and performed that day many brilliant wonderful feats which he had not learned from any other not from scthach nor from athach nor from afe  fer diad saw these feats and knew that they would in due course be directed against him what feat of arms shall we perform today fer diad said c chulainn yours is the choice until nightfall said fer diad let us perform the feat of the ford then said c chulainn let us do so indeed said fer diad but though he said that it was the feat he deemed it hardest to encounter for he knew that it was at the feat of the ford that c chulainn overthrew every champion and every warrior he encountered great was the deed that was done on the ford that day the two heroes the two champions and the two chariotfighters of western europe the two bright torches of valour of the irish the two bestowers of gifts and rewards and wages in the northwestern world the two mainstays of the valour of the irish coming from afar to encounter each other through the sowing of dissension and the stirring up of strife by ailill and medb each of them began to cast these weapons at each other from the twilight of early morning until midday and when midday came the rage of the combatants grew fiercer and they drew closer to each other  then for the first time c chulainn sprang from the brink of the ford on to the boss of fer diads shield trying to strike his head from above the rim of the shield fer diad gave the shield a blow with his left elbow and cast c chulainn off like a bird on to the brink of the ford again c chulainn sprang from the brink of the ford on to the boss of fer diads shield seeking to strike his head from above the rim of the shield fer diad gave the shield a blow with his left knee and cast c chulainn off like a child on to the brink of the ford leg noticed what was happening alas said leg your opponent has chastised you as a fond mother chastises her child he had belaboured you as flax  is beaten in a pond he had ground you as a mill grinds malt he has pierced you as a tool pierces an oak he has bound you as a twining plant binds trees he has attacked you as a  p  line  hawk attacks little birds so that never again will you have a claim or right or title to valour of feats of arms you distorted little sprite said leg then for the third time c chulainn rose up as swift as the wind as speedy as the swallow as fierce as the dragon as strong as the air and landed on the boss of fer diads shield seeking to strike his head from above the rim of the shield then the warrior shook the shield and cast off c chulainn into the bed of the ford as if he had never leapt at all   then occurred c chulainns first distortion he swelled and grew big as a bladder does when inflated and became a fearsome terrible manycoloured strange arch and the valiant hero towered high above fer diad as big a fomir or a pirate  such was the closeness of their encounter that their heads met above their feet below and their hands in the middle over the rims and bosses of the shields such was the closeness of their encounter that they clove and split their shields from rims to centres such was the closeness of their encounter that they caused their spears to bend and turn and yield to pressure from points to rivets such was the closeness of their encounter that sprites and goblins and spirits of the glen and demons of the air screamed from the rims of their shields and from the hilts of their swords and from the buttends of their spears such was the closeness of their encounter that they forced the river from its usual course and extent and a couch might have been prepared for king or queen on the floor of the ford for not a drop of water remained there except what might drip there with the wrestling and trampling of the two heroes and champions on the floor of the ford such was the closeness of their encounter that the horses of the irish went mad and frenzied and broke their spancels and shackles their ropes and traces and women and boys and children and those unfit to fight and the mad among the men of ireland broke out through the camp southwestwards  by this time the two combatants were at the edgefeat of swords then fer diad caught c chulainn unguarded and dealt him a blow with his ivoryhilted blade which he plunged into c chulainns breast and c chulainns blood dripped into his belt and the ford was red with the blood from the warriors body c chulainn brooked not this wounding for fer diad attacked him with a succession of deadly stout blows and he asked leg for the ga bulgasuch was the nature of the ga bulga: it used to be set downstream and cast from between the toes: it made  p  line  one wound as it entered a mans body but it had thirty barbs when one tried to remove it and it was not taken from a mans body until the flesh was cut away about it and when fer diad heard the mention of the ga bulga he thrust down the shield to shelter the lower part of his body c chulainn cast the fine spear from off the palm of this hand over the rim of the shield and over the breast piece of the hornskin so that its farther half was visible after it had pierced fer diads heart in his breast fer diad thrust up the shield to protect the upper part of his body but that was help that came too late the charioteer sent the ga bulga downstream c chulainn caught it between his toes and made a cast of it at fer diad and the ga bulga went through the strong thick apron of smelted iron and broke in three the great stone as big as a millstone and entered fer diads body through the anus and filled every joint and limb of him with its barbs that suffices now said fer diad i have fallen by that cast but indeed strongly do you cast from your right foot and it was not fitting that i should fall by you as he spoke he uttered these words:  fer diad  o hound of the fair feats it was not fitting that you should slay me yours is the guilt which clung to me on you my blood was shed  doomed men who reach the gap of betrayal do not flourish sad is my voice alas heroes  have been destroyed  my ribs like spoils are broken my heart is gore would that i had not fought i have fallen o hound  then c chulainn hastened towards him and clasped him in his arms and lifted him up with his weapons and armour and equipment and took him northwards across the ford so that his spoils might be to the north of the ford and not to the west with the men of ireland c chulainn laid fer diad on the ground there and as he stood over fer diad a swoon and faintness and weakness came upon him leg saw that and he feared that all the men of ireland would come and attack c chulainn come little hound said leg arise now for the men of ireland will come to attack us and it will not be single combat that they will grant us since fer diad mac damin meic dire has fallen at your hands what avails it me to arise now fellow said c chulainn p  line  considering the man who has fallen by me as the servant spoke he said these words and c chulainn answered him: charioteer  arise o warhound of emain high courage befits you more than ever you have cast off fer diad of the hosts gods doom your fight was hard  c chulainn  what avails me high courage madness and grief have hemmed me in after the deed i have done and the body that i have wounded harshly with my sword  charioteer  it was not fitting for you to mourn him fitter for you to boast in triumph the strong man armed with spears has left you mournful wounded bleeding  c chulainn  even had he cut off a leg from me or a hand i still grieve that fer diad who rode on steeds is not living for ever  charioteer  the maidens of the red branch are better pleased at what has been done that he should die and you should live though they do not deem it a small thing that you two should be parted for ever  since the day you left cailnge in pursuit of the brilliant medb all that you have killed of her fighters she deems indeed a famous carnage  you have not slept peacefully in pursuit of your great herd though your company was few yet many a morning you rose early  c chulainn began to lament for and commiserate with fer diad then and he spoke these words:  alas fer diad sad for you that you spoke not with one of the company who knew of my great deeds of valour and arms before we met together in conflict  sad for you that leg mac riangbra did not put you to shame with counsel about our comradeship  sad for you that you did not agree to the clear advice of fergus  sad for you that conall the fair triumphant exultant victorious conall did not help you  p  line  for those men do not follow the messages or desires or sayings or the false promises of the fairhaired women of connacht for those men know that there will not be born among the connachtmen a being to perform deeds equal to yours in the wielding of shields and bucklers of spears and swords in the playing of chess and draughts in the driving of horses and chariots  there will not be a heros hand to hack warriors flesh like that of fer diad the shapely scion the breach made by the redmouthed wargoddess will not be dug up  for encampments full of shimmering shields it will not be crachain that will contend for or obtain covenants equal to yours till the very end of life now o redcheeked son of damn said c chulainn  then c chulainn rose and stood over fer diad ah fer diad said c chulainn greatly did the men of ireland betray and abandon you when they brought you to fight and do combat with me for to contend and do battle with me on the foray of cailnge was no easy task  as he spoke he said these words:  c chulainn  o fer diad you have been betrayed alas for your last meeting where you have died while i remain alas for ever for our long parting  when we were yonder with scthach the victorious we thought that till great doomsday our friendship would not end  dear to me was your splendid blush dear your perfect and fair form dear your bright clear eye dear your bearing and your speech  there never strode to fleshrending fight there never grew wrathful in his manliness there never held shield upon the wide slope one like unto you warlike son of damn  i have never met such as you until now since the only son of afe fell your peer in deeds of battle i found not here o fer diad  findabair the daughter of medb though great her beauty it is as vain to show her now to you o fer diad as to bind a withe around sand or gravel  p  line  then c chulainn began to gaze at fer diad well now my friend leg said c chulainn strip fer diad and take off his armour and his clothes that i may see the brooch for the sake of which he did battle leg came and stripped fer diad he took his armour and clothing from him and c chulainn saw the brooch and began to mourn for fer diad and to commiserate him and he spoke these words:  c chulainn  alas for the golden brooch  alas  brooch translating st   o fer diad of the hosts o strong and valiant smiter victorious was your arm your thick yellow hair was curlya fair jewel your girdle supple and ornamented was around you until your death  our true comradeship was a delight for the eye of a nobleman your shield with its golden rim your chessboard worth much treasure  that you should fall by my hand i acknowledge was not just our fight was not gentle alas for the golden brooch  alas  brooch translating st  well my friend leg said c chulainn cut open fer diad now and remove the ga bulga for i cannot be without my weapon leg came and cut open fer diad and removed the ga bulga and c chulainn saw his bloodstained crimson weapon lying beside fer diad and spoke these words:  c chulainn   o fer diad it is sad that i should see you thus bloodstained yet drained of blood while i have not as yet cleansed my weapon of its stains and you lie there in a bed of gore   when we were yonder in the east with scthach and with athach there would not be pale lips between us and weapons of battle   sharply scthach spoke her strong firm command: go ye all to the swift battle germn garbglas will come  p  line   i said to fer diad and to generous lugaid and to fer beth the son of fair betn that we should go to meet germn   we went to the rocks of battle above the sloping shore of loch lindfhormait four hundred we brought out from the islands of the victorious   when i and valiant fer diad stood before the fort of germn i killed rind mac nuil and he slew fad mac fornuil   on the battlefield fer beth killed blth son of colba of the red sword and lugaid the stern and swift slew mugairne from the tyrrhene sea   after going in i slew four hundred wrathful men fer diad slew dam dreimed and dam dlenda stern company   we laid waste the fort of wise germn above the wide manycoloured sea we brought germn alive to scthach of the broad shield   our fostermother imposed on us a pact of friendship and agreement that we should not grow angry with the tribe of fair elg   sad was the battle that slaughtering battle in which the son of damn was struck down in weakness alas the friend to whom i served a drink of red blood has fallen   had i seen you die amidst the warriors of great greece i should not have survived you we should have died together   sad what befalls us the fosterlings of scthach i am wounded and covered with red gore while you no longer drive chariots   sad what befalls us the fosterlings of scthach i am wounded and covered with red gore while you lie dead   sad what befalls us the fosterlings of scthach you dead i alive and strong valour is an angry combat  p  line  well o little c said leg let us leave this ford now too long have we been here we shall leave it indeed friend leg said c chulainn but to me every battle and contest i have fought seems but play and sport compared with my fight against fer diad and as he spoke he said these words:  c chulainn   game was all and sport was all until it came to my meeting with fer diad on the ford the same instruction we had the same power of guarantee  the same tender fostermother we had whose name is beyond all others   all was play and sport compared with my meeting with fer diad on the ford the same nature we had the same fearsomeness the same weapons we used to wield scthach once gave two shields to me and to fer diad   all was play and sport compared with my meeting with fer diad on the ford beloved was he the golden pillar whom i laid low on the ford o strong one of the tribes you were more valiant than all others   all was play and sport compared with my meeting with fer diad on the ford the furious fiery lion the wave wild and swelling like the day of doom   all was play and sport compared with my meeting with fer diad at the ford i thought that beloved fer diad would live after me for ever yesterday he was huge as a mountain today only his shadow remains   three uncountable bands there fell by my hand on the foray the finest men the finest cattle and horses i slaughtered on every side   though numerous the army which came from stout crachu yet i slew more than a third of them and less than half with the rough plying of my weapons   there has not come into the centre of battle nor has banba ever nurtured nor has there travelled over land or sea any kings son more famous than fer diad  thus far the tragic death of fer diad  p  there came now to help and succour c chulainn a few of the ulstermen namely senall uathach and the two maic fecce muiredach and cotreb they took him to the streams and rivers of conaille muirthemne to wash and cleanse his wounds and his stabs his cuts and many sores against the current of those streams and rivers for the tatha de danann used to put herbs and healing plants and charms on the streams and rivers in conaille muirthemne to help and succour c chulainn so that the streams used to be speckled and greensurfaced from them  these are the names of the rivers which healed c chulainn:  ss ban bithln findglais gleir glenamain bedg tadg telameit rind bir brenide dichaem muach miliuc

so mac roth came to slab fait not long was he there when he saw a single chariotwarrior on slab fait coming straight towards him from the north in the chariot was a man starknaked with neither weapon nor garment save only an iron spit in his hand with which he pricked alike his charioteer and his horses and it seemed to him as if he would never reach the hosts while they were still alive mac roth brought these tidings to the place where were ailill and medb and fergus with the nobles of the men of ireland ailill asked news of him on his arrival well mac roth said ailill have you seen any one of the ulstermen on the track of this host today i know not indeed said mac roth but i saw a solitary chariotfighter coming straight across slab fait in the chariot there is a man starknaked with no garment or weapon at all except for an iron spit in his hand with which he pricks alike both his charioteer and his horses for it seemed to him that he would not reach this host in time to find them alive  who would you think was yonder fergus said ailill i think said fergus that it would be cethern mac fintain coming there it was true for fergus that it was cethern mac fintain arriving there then cethern mac fintain reached them and the fort and encampment was overthrown  on them and he wounds them all around him in every direction and on all sides he too is wounded from all sides and points then he came from them with his entrails and intestines hanging out to the place  p  line  where c chulainn was being cured and healed and he asked c chulainn for a physician to cure and heal him well my friend leg said c chulainn go to the encampment of the men of ireland and tell their physicians to come forth and cure cethern mac fintain i swear that though they be hidden underground or in a locked house i shall inflict death on them before this hour tomorrow if they do not come leg came forward to the encampment of the men of ireland and bade their physicians come forth and cure cethern mac fintain the physicians of the men of ireland thought it no pleasant task to come and cure one who was to them a foe and an enemy and an outlander but they feared that c chulainn would inflict death on them if they did not come so they came as each man reached him cethern mac fintain would show him his wounds and his gashes his sores and his bleeding cuts to each man who would say: he will not live he cannot be cured cethern mac fintain would deal a blow with his right fist in the middle of his forehead and drive his brains out through the orifices of his ears and the joinings of his skull however cethern mac fintain slew up to fifteen of the physicians of the men of ireland as for the fifteenth man only a glancing blow reached him but he lay unconscious in a heavy swoon among the corpses of the other physicians for a long time his name was ithall the physician of ailill and medb then cethern mac fintain asked c chulainn for another physician to heal and cure him well now friend leg said c chulainn go for me to fngin the seerphysician the physician of conchobor at ferta fngin in lecca slebe fait and let him come hither heal cethern mac fintain leg came on to the seerphysician fngin at ferta fngin in lecca slebe fuait and told him to come and cure cethern mac fintain showed him his wounds and his stabs his gashes and his bleeding cuts  examine this wound for me master fngin said cethern fngin examined the wound this is a slight wound given unwillingly by one of your own blood said the physician and it would not carry you off prematurelylt  that is true indeed said cethern one man came to me there he had a crest of hair he wore a blue cloak wrapped around him a silver brooch in the cloak over his breast he carried a curved shield with scalloped edge in his hand a five pointed spear and beside it a small pronged spear he dealt this wound and he got a slight wound  p  line  from me too we know that man said c chulainn that was illand ilarchless the son of fergus and he had no desire that you should fall by his hand but gave that mockthrust at you lest the men of ireland should say that he was betraying or abandoning them if he did not give it examine this wound also for me master fngin said cethern fngin examined the wound this is the deed of a proud woman said the physician that is true indeed said cethern there came to me there a woman tall beautiful pale and longfaced she had flowing goldenyellow hair she wore a crimson hooded cloak with a golden brooch over her breast a straight ridged spear blazing in her hand she gave me that wound and she too got a slight wound from me we know that woman said c chulainn it was medb the daughter of eochu feidlech the highking of ireland who came in that wise she would have deemed it victory and triumph and cause for boasting had you fallen at her hands  examine then this wound for me master fngin said cethern fngin examined the wound this is the attack of two champions said the physician it is true indeed said cethern two men came to me there they had crests of hair two blue cloaks wrapped about them silver brooches in the cloaks above their breasts a necklace of pure white silver round the neck of each of them we know those two men said c chulainn they were oll and othine members of the household of ailill and medb they never go into battle that they are not assured of wounding a man they would deem it victory and triumph and cause for boasting that you should fall at their hands  examine this wound for me now master fngin said cethern fngin examined that wound two warriors came to me there of splendid manly appearance each of them thrust a spear in me and i thrust this spear through one of them fngin examined that wound this wound is all black said the physician the spears went through your heart and crossed each other within it and i prophesy no cure here but i would procure for you some herbs of healing and curing so that the wounds should not carry you off prematurely we know these two said c chulainn they were bun and mecconn of the household of ailill and medb they desired that you should fall at their hands  examine this wound for me now master fngin said cethern fngin examined the wound this was the bloody onset of the  p  line  two sons of the king of caill that is true said cethern there came to me two warriors fairfaced dark browed tall with golden crowns on their heads two green mantles wrapped about them two brooches of white silver in the mantles over their breasts two fivepronged spears in their hands very numerous are the wounds that have inflicted on you said the physician into your gullet the spears went and their points met within you nor is it easy to work a cure here we know these two said c chulainn they are bren and brudne the sons of three lights the tow sons of the king of caill they would think it victory and triumph and cause for boasting if you should fall by them examine this wound for me master fngin said cethern fngin examined that wound this was the attack  of two brothers said the physician that is true indeed said cethern there came to me two choice warriors they had yellow hair darkgrey fringed cloaks wrapped about them leafshaped brooches of white bronze in the mantles over their breasts broad shining spears in their hands we know those two said c chulainn they are cormac coloma rg and cormac mac maele foga of the household of ailill and medb they would have wished you to fall at their hands  examine for me this wound master fngin said cethern fngin examined that wound this was the attempt of two brothers said the physician it is true indeed said cethern there came to me two youthful warriors both alike one had curling brown hair the other curling yellow hair two green mantles were wrapped around them and two brooches of bright silver were in the mantles over their breasts two shirts of smooth yellow silk next to their skin brighthilted swords at their girdles two bright shields they carried ornamented with animal designs in silver two five pronged spears with rings of pure white silver they bore in their hands we know those two said c chulainn they were maine mithremail and maine aithremail two sons of ailill and medb they would deem it victory and triumph and cause for boasting if you should fall at their hands  examine this wound for me master fngin said cethern two warriors came to me there a brilliant appearance they had and they were tall and manly they wore strange foreign clothes each of them thrust a spear into me and i thrust a spear into each of them fingin examined the wound severe are the wounds they have inflicted on you said the physician they  p  line  have severed the sinews of your heart within you so that your heart rolls about in your breast like an apple in movement  or like a ball of thread in an empty bag and there is not a sinew supporting it at all and i cannot effect a cure here we know those two said c chulainn they are two of the warriors of irath who were chosen expressly by ailill and medb that they might kill you since not often does anyone survive their attack for they desired that you should fall at their hands examine this wound for me master fngin said cethern fngin examined that wound this was the thrust of a father and son said the physician it is true indeed said cethern there came to me two tall men with shining eyes with golden diadems flashing on their heads they wore kingly raiment goldhilted ornamented swords at their girdles with scabbards of pure white silver and rings of variegated gold outside them we know those two said c chulainn they were ailill and his son maine condasgeib uile they would deem it victory and triumph and cause of congratulation if you had fallen at their hands  thus far the wounds of cethern on the tin  well then fngin seerphysician said cethern mac fintain what remedy and advice do you give me now what i say to you said fngin the seerphysician is that you should not exchange  translating st  your great cows for yearlings this year for if you do it is not you who will enjoy them and they will not profit you that is the remedy and advice the other physicians gave me and it is certain that it brought them no advantage or profit but they fell by me and neither shall it bring advantage or profit to you for you will fall by me and cethern gave him a strong violent kick so that he landed between the two wheels of the chariot wicked is that old mans  kick said c chulainn whence the name of achtar la in crch rois from that day until today nevertheless fngin fithlaig gave his choice to cethern mac fintain: either a long illness and afterwards help and succour or else a temporary healing during three days and three nights that he might then exert all his strength against his enemies cethern chose a temporary healing of three days and three nights that he might himself exert all his strength against his enemies  p  line  for as he said he would leave behind him no one he would better like to take vengeance for him than himself so then fngin fithlaig asked c chulainn for a marrowmash to cure and heal cethern mac fintain c chulainn proceeded to the encampment of the men of ireland and brought from there all he found of their herds and flocks and droves and made of them a mash flesh and bones and hides all together and cethern was placed in the marrowmash for the space of three days and three nights and he began to soak up the marrowmash which was about him and the marrow entered into his wounds and gashes his sores and many stabs then after three days and three nights he arose from the marrowmash and thus it was that he arose: with the board of his chariot pressed to his belly to prevent his entrails from falling out that was the time when his wife finda daughter of eochu came from the north from dn da benn bringing him his sword cethern mac fintain came towards the men of ireland however he gave a warning of his coming to thall the physician of ailill and medb thall had lain unconscious in a heavy swoon among the corpses of the other physicians for a long space of time o men of ireland said the physician cethern son of fintan will come to attack you now that he has been cured and healed by fngin fithlaig so make ready to answer him then the men of ireland put ailills garments and his golden crown on the pillarstone in crch rois that cethern mac fintain might first wreak his rage on it when he arrived cethern saw ailills garments and his golden crown on the pillarstone and for want of information he thought that it was ailill himself who was there he made a rush at it and drove the sword through the pillarstone up to its hilt this is a trick said cethern and against me it has been played and i swear that until there be found among you some one to put on that royal dress and golden crown i see yonder i shall not cease to smite and slaughter them maine ande the son of ailill and medb heard this and he put on the royal dress and golden crown and advanced through the midst of the men of ireland cethern pursued him closely and made a cast of his shield at him and the scalloped edge of the shield cut him in three to the ground together with chariot and charioteer and horses then the armies attacked cethern on both sides and he fell at their hands in the spot where he was  those are the tales of caladgle cethirn and fuile cethirn  p  here follows fiacalgle fintain fintan was the son of niall niamglonnach from dn da benn and the father of cethern and he came to avenge the honour of the ulstermen and to take revenge for his sons death on the hosts thrice fifty was the number of their band and they came with two spearheads on every shaft a spearhead on the point and a spearhead on the butt so that they wounded the hosts alike with points and butts they gave battle three times to the hosts and three times their own number fell by them and there fell also all the people of fintan mac neill except crimthann the son of fintan who was saved by ailill and medb under a shelter of shields then the men of ireland said that it would be no disgrace to fintan mac neill to evacuate the encampment for him and that his son crimthann should be allowed to go free with him while the hosts should withdraw a days march to the north and he should cease to attack the hosts until such time as he should come to them on the day of the great battle when the four great provinces of ireland should meet at girech and ilgirech in the foray of cailnge as had been prophesied by the druids of the men of ireland fintan mac neill agreed to this and his son was set free to him the encampment was evacuated for him and the hosts retreated a days journey northwards again checking and holding themselves back and each man of fintans people and each man of the men of ireland were found with the lips and nose of each of them in the teeth of the other the men of ireland noticed this and said: this is the toothfight for us the toothfight of fintans people and of fintan himself  so that is fiacalgle fintain  here follows ruadrucce mind mend mac slcholgn was from rena na binne his force numbered twelve men they had two spear heads on each shaft a spearhead on the point and a spearhead on the butt so that they wounded the hosts alike with points and butts they attacked the hosts three times and three times their own number fell by them and twelve of mends people fell but mend himself was wounded grievously so that he was reddened and bloodstained then said the men of ireland: red is this shame for mend mac slcholgn that his people should be killed and destroyed and he himself be wounded until he is reddened and bloodstained  p  line  this is ruadrucce mind  then the men of ireland said that it were no disgrace for mend mac slcholgn if the encampment were cleared for him and if the hosts went back a days journey to the north again provided that he should cease to attack the hosts until conchobor recovered from his debility and gave them battle at girech and ilgirech as the druids and prophets and seers of the men of ireland had foretold  mend mac slcholgn agreed that the encampment should be vacated the hosts withdrew a days journey to the north again checking and staying themselves  here follows airecur narad then the charioteers of the ulstermen came to them three fifties in number they gave battle three times to the host and three times their own number fell by them and the charioteers fell on the level spot on which they stood  that is airecor narad  here follows bngle rochada reochaid mac faithemain was of the ulstermen his force numbered one hundred and fifty and he took up his position on a hillock opposite the host findabair the daughter of ailill and medb noticed that and she said to her mother medb: i loved yonder warrior long ago and he is my beloved and my chosen wooer if you loved him my daughter spend tonight with him and ask him for a truce for us with the host until he come to us on the day of the great battle where the four great provinces of ireland will meet at girech and ilgirech at the battle of the foray of cailnge reochaid mac faithemain agreed to that and the girl spent that night with him  one of the underkings of munster who was in the camp heard of this and said to his people: that girl was betrothed to me long ago and that is why i have come now upon this hosting however as for the seven underkings of munster they all said that that was why they had come why then said they should we not go to take vengeance for the woman and for our honour on the maines who are keeping guard in the rear of the host at imlech in glendamrach  p  line  that was the plan they decided upon and they arose with their seven divisions of three thousand then ailill rose to oppose them with his three thousand medb rose with her three thousand and the sons of mgu with their divisions the gailein and the munstermen and the people of tara rose intervention was made between them so that each man sat next to the other and beside his weapons yet before the intervention was accomplished eight hundred valiant men from among them had fallen findabair the daughter of ailill and medb heard that this number of the men of ireland had fallen because of her and on account of her and her heart cracked like a nut in her breast through shame and modesty findabair slebe is the name of the spot where she died then said the men of ireland: bloodless is this fight for reochaid mac faithemain since eight hundred valiant soldiers have fallen because of him but he himself has escaped without a wound and without shedding his blood  that is bngle rochada  mellgle illiach liach was the son of cas mac baicc meic rosa raid meic rudraige he was told how the four great provinces of ireland had been plundering and laying waste ulster and pictland from the monday at the beginning of samain until the beginning of spring and he took counsel with his people what better plan could i devise than to go and attack the men of ireland and win victory over them and avenge the honour of ulster it matters not if i myself fall thereafter and that was the plan he decided on his two old decrepit mangy horses which were on the strand beside the fort were harnessed for him and his old chariot whithout any rugs or covering was yoked to the horses he took up his rough darkcoloured iron shield with the rim of hard silver around it on his left side he put his rough heavysmiting sword with grey guard he took his two gapped shakyheaded spears in the chariot beside him his people filled his chariot around him with stones and rocks and great flagstones in this wise he came forward towards the men of ireland with his private parts hanging through the chariot we should like indeed said the men of ireland if it were thus that all the ulstermen came to us  dche mac mgach met him and welcomed him welcome is your arrival liach said dche mac mgach i trust that  p  line  welcome said liach but come to me presently when my weapons are exhausted and when my valour has diminished so that you may be the one to behead me and not any other man of the men of ireland but keep my sword for legaire liach plied his weapons on the men of ireland until he had exhausted them and when his weapons were exhausted he attacked the men of ireland with stones and rocks and great flagstones until they too were exhausted and when they were finished wherever he could seize one of the men of ireland he would crush him swiftly between his arms and his hands and make a marrowmash of him flesh and bones sinews and skin all together and the two marrowmashes still remain side by side the one which c chulainn made from the bones of the ulstermens cattle to cure cethern mac fintain and the one which liach made from the bones of the men of ireland so that all those who fell at the hands of liach are called one of the three uncountable slayings of the tin and that tale is called mellgleo nliach  it was called mellgle nliach because he fought his fight with stones and rocks and great flagstones  dche mac mgach met him is not this liach said dche it is i indeed said liach but come to me now and cut off my head and keep my sword for your friend legaire dche came to him and with a stroke of the sword cut off his head  thus far mellgle lliach  oislige amargin in tailtiu amairgin was the son of cas mac baicc meic rosa raid meic rudraige he overtook the hosts going westwards over tailtiu and he turned them and drove them northwards over tailtiu he lay on his left elbow in tailtiu and his people furnished him with stones and rocks and great flagstones and he fell to pelting the men of ireland for three days and three nights  concerning c ru mac dire c ru was told that a single man had been holding the four great provinces of ireland in check from the monday at the beginning of samain until the beginning of spring he was grieved by this and he thought that his people had been without him for too long so he came forward to do battle and combat with c chulainn  p  line  when he reached the place where c chulainn was he saw him lying there groaning wounded and stabbed and he scorned to do battle or combat with him after c chulainns fight with fer diad lest c chulainn should die not so much of the wounds and gashes which he would inflict on him as of those which fer diad had already inflicted on him nevertheless c chulainn offered to engage in battle with c ru c ru went forward then to the men of ireland and when he got there he saw amairgin lying on his left elbow to the west of tailtiu c ru came to the north of the men of ireland his people furnished him with stones and rocks and great flagstones and he began to hurl them directly against amargin so that the warlike battlestones collided in the clouds and in the air over their heads and each stone was shattered into a hundred pieces by the truth of your valour c ru said medb cease from this stone throwing for it is no help to us but a hindrance i swear said c ru that i shall not cease till the day of doom until amargin cease too i shall do so said amargin and do you undertake not to come again to help and succour the men of ireland c ru agreed to that and went away to his own land and his own people  by this time they had gone westwards past tailtiu it was not the agreement i made said amargin not to cast stones at the host again so he came to the west of them and turned them before him to the northeast past tailtiu and began to pelt them for a long time  then said the men of ireland that it would be no dishonour for amargin if they vacated the encampment and the hosts went back a days journey northwards holding themselves in check and that amargin should cease to attack the hosts until he came to them on the day of the great battle where the four great provinces of ireland would meet at girech and ilgirech in the battle of the foray of cailnge amargin agreed to that and the hosts withdrew a days journey northwards once more  that is oislige amargin in tailtiu  the long warning of sultaim sualtaim was the son of becaltach mac mraltaig and the father of c chulainn he was told of the distress of his son fighting against odds with calatn dna and his twentyseven sons and  p  line  his grandson glas mac delga this is from afar said sualtaim is it the sky that cracks or the sea that ebbs or the earth that splits or is it the distress of my son against odds on the foray of cailnge sualtaim spoke truly indeed and he went to c chulainn presently though he did not go at once when sualtaim came to where c chulainn was he began to lament and commiserate with him c chulainn liked not that sualtaim should lament and pity him for he knew that though he was wounded and injured sualtaim would be no protection to avenge him for the truth was that sualtaim was not a coward but neither was he a valiant fighter but only a middling one well now father sualtaim said c chulainn go to the ulstermen in emain and tell them to go now after their cattle for i am unable to protect them any longer in the gaps and passes of the land of conaille muirthmene i have stood alone against the four great provinces of ireland from monday at the beginning of samain until the beginning of spring killing one man at the ford every day and a hundred warriors every night fair play is not granted to me nor single combat and no one comes to help or succour me bent hoops of fresh hazel keep my mantle from touching me dry wisps of tow are stuffed in my wounds from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet there is not a hair whereon the point of a needle could rest but has a drop of crimson blood on its very tip except alone my left hand which is holding my shield and even that hand has thrice fifty wounds on it and unless they take vengeance for that at once they will never do so until the brink of doom sualtaim set forth on the lath macha as his only horse to take these warnings to the ulstermen and when he reached the side of emain he spoke these words: men are slain women carried off cattle driven away o ulstermen  he got not the answer that sufficed him from the ulstermen and so he came forward opposite emain and spoke the same words there: men are slain women carried off cattle driven away o ulstermen he got not the answer that sufficed him from the ulstermenthis is how it was with the ulstermen: it was tabu for them to speak before their king and it was tabu for the king to speak before his druidssualtaim came forward then to the stone of the hostages in emain macha he spoke the same words there: men are killed women carried off cattle driven away who kills them and who carries them off and who drives them away said cathbath the druid ailill and medb have ravaged  p  line  you said sualtaim your womenfolk and your sons and your youths have been carried off your horses and your steeds your herds and your flocks and your cattle c chulainn alone is checking and holding back the four great provinces of ireland in the gaps and passes of conaille muirthemne fair play is not granted to him nor single combat and no one comes to aid or succour him the youth has been wounded blood has drained from his wounds bent hoops of fresh hazel hold his mantle over him there is not a hair from his head to his feet on which the point of a needle could stand but has a drop of bright red blood on its tip save only the left hand which holds his shield and even that hand bears thrice fifty wounds and unless ye avenge this at once ye will never avenge it until the end of doom and life more fitting is death and destruction for the man who so incites the king said cathbath the druid that is true indeed said all the ulstermen sualtaim went his way in anger and wrath since he got not the answer which sufficed him from the ulstermen then the lath macha reared under sualtaim and came forward opposite emain and his own shield turned on sualtaim and its rim cut off his head the horse itself turned back again into emain with the shield on the horse and the head on the shield and sualtaims head spoke the same words men are slain women carried off cattle driven away o ulstermen said the head of sualtaim a little too loud is that cry said conchobor for the sky is above us the earth beneath us and the sea all around us but unless the sky with its showers of stars fall upon the surface of the earth or unless the ground burst open in an earthquake or unless the fishabounding blue bordered sea come over the surface of the earth i shall bring back every cow to its byre and enclosure every woman to her own abode and dwelling after victory in battle and combat and contest then a messenger of his own household met conchobor to wit findchad fer bend uma mac frechlethain and conchobor bade him go and assemble and muster the men of ulster and even as he enumerated the quick and the dead for him in the intoxication of his trance and his sickness he said these words: arise o findchad i send you forth it is not desirable to neglect

assembly which conchobor had ordered for those who were east of emain and west of emain and north of emain came forth at once and spent the night at emain at the behest of their king and the command of their prince awaiting the recovery of conchobor but those who were south of emain set forth at once on the track of the host along the road beaten out by the hooves of the cattle  on the first stage of the journey on which the ulstermen set forth with conchobor they spent the night at irard cuillend what do we wait for here o men said conchobor we await your sons said they fiacha and fiachna they have gone from us to fetch erc the son of your daughter fedlimid nchruthach and of cairbre nia fer that he may come to our army at this juncture with his full muster and assembly his full gathering and levy i vow said conchobor that i shall not await them here any longer until the men of ireland hear that i have recovered from the weakness and debility in which i was for the men of ireland do not know yet if i am still alive  then conchobor and celtchair went to th nirmide with thirty hundred chariotfighters armed with spears and there they met eight score big men of the household of ailill and medb with eight score captive women one captive woman held prisoner by each man of them that was their share of the plunder of ulster conchobor and celtchair struck off their eight score heads and freed their eight score captives th nirmide was the name of that place until then but it is called th feinne ever since the reason it is called th feinne is because the warriors of the warband fian from the east and the warriors of the warband from the west met there in battle and contest on the brink of the ford  conchobor and celtchair came back and spent that night in irard cuillend beside the men of ulster the trance of celtchair follows here  then celtchair uttered these words among the ulstermen in irard cuillend that night: taible lethderggap: rhetoric untranslatedextent:  lines  p  line  in the same night cormac cond longas the son of conchobor spoke these words among the men of ireland in slemain mide: amra maitnegap: rhetoric untranslatedextent:  lines  in the same night dubthach del ulad spoke these words among the men of ireland in slemain mide: mra maitnegap: rhetoric untranslatedextent:  lines  then dubthach awoke from his sleep and the nemain brought confusion on the host so that they made a clangour of arms with the points of their spears and their swords and a hundred warriors of them died on the floor of their encampment through the fearsomeness of the shout they had raised however that was not the most peaceful night ever experienced by the men of ireland at any time because of the prophecies and the predictions and because of the spectres and visions which appeared to them  then said ailill: i have succeeded in laying waste ulster and the land of the picts from the monday at the beginning of samain until the beginning of spring we have carried off their womenfolk their sons and their youths their horses and steeds their flocks and herds and cattle we have levelled their hills behind them into lowlands so that they might be of equal height wherefore i shall not wait here for them any longer but let them give me battle on mag a if it so please them and yet though we say this let some one go forth to reconnoitre the broad plain of meath to see whether the ulstermen come thither and if they do i shall in no wise retreat for it is not the good custom of a king ever to retreat who should go there said they all who but mac roth the chief messenger yonder  mac roth came forward to reconnoitre the great plain of meath not long was he there when he heard a noise and a tumult and a clamour it seemed to him almost as if the sky had fallen on to the surface of the earth or as if the fishabounding blue bordered sea had swept across the face of the world or as if the earth had split in an earthquake or as if the trees of the forest had all fallen into each others forks and bifurcations and branches however the wild beasts were hunted across the plain in such numbers that the surface of the plain of meath was not visible beneath them  mac roth came to report that to where ailill was with medb and fergus and the nobles of the men of ireland he related those tidings to them what was that fergus asked ailill not difficult to tell said fergus the noise and clamour and  p  line  tumult that he heard the din and the thunder and the uproar were the ulstermen attacking the wood the throng of champions and warriors cutting down the trees with their swords in front of their chariots it was that which hunted the wild beasts across the plain so that the surface of the plain of meath is not visible beneath them once more mac roth scanned the plain he saw a great grey mist which filled the void between heaven and earth he seemed to see islands in lakes above the slopes of the mist he seemed to see yawning caverns in the forefront of the mist itself it seemed to him that purewhite linen cloths or sifted snow dropping down appeared to him through a rift in the same mist he seemed to see a flock of varied wonderful numerous birds or the shimmering of shining stars on a bright frosty night or the sparks of a blazing fire he heard a noise and a tumult a din and thunder a clamour and uproar he came forward to tell those tidings to where were ailill and medb and fergus and the nobles of the men of ireland he told them these things  what was that fergus asked ailill not difficult to tell said fergus the grey mist he saw which filled the void between earth and sky was the expiration of the breath of horses and heroes and the cloud of dust from the ground and from the roads which rises above them driven by the wind so that it becomes a heavy deepgrey mist in the clouds and in the air  the islands in lakes which he saw there and the tops of hills and mounds rising above the valleys of the mist were the heads of the heroes and warriors above their chariots and the chariots themselves the yawning caverns he saw there in the forefront of the same mist were the mouths and nostrils of horses and heroes exhaling and inhaling the sun and the wind with the swiftness of the host  the purewhite linen cloths he saw there or the sifted snow dropping down were the foam and froth that the bits of the reins cast from the mouths of the strong stout steeds with the fierce rush of the host the flock of varied wonderful numerous birds which he saw there was the dust of the ground and the surface of the earth which the horses flung up form their feet and their hooves and which rose above them with the driving of the wind  the noise and the tumult the din and the thunder the clamour and the outcry which he heard there was the shock of shields and the smiting of spears and the loud striking of swords the clashing of helmets the clangour of breastplates the friction of the weapons  p  line  and the vehemence of the feats of arms the straining of ropes the rattle of wheels the trampling of the horses hoofs and the creaking of chariots and the loud voices of heroes and warriors coming towards us here the shimmering of shining stars on a bright night that he saw there of the sparks of a blazing fire were the fierce fearsome eyes of the warriors and heroes from the beautiful shapely ornamented helmets eyes full of the fury and anger with which they came against which neither equal combat nor overwhelming number prevailed at any time and against which none will ever prevail until the day of doom  we make little account of it said medb goodly warriors and goodly soldiers will be found among us to oppose them i do not count on that medb said fergus for i pledge my word that you will not find in ireland or in alba a host which could oppose the ulstermen when once their fits of wrath come upon them  then the four great provinces of ireland made their encampment at clrtha that night they left a band to keep watch and guard against the ulstermen lest they should come upon them unawares  then conchobor and celtchair set forth with thirty hundred chariotfighters armed with spears and halted in slemain mide in the rear of the host but though we say halted they did not halt completely but came forward presently to the encampment of medb and ailill in an attempt to be the first to shed blood  not long was mac roth there when he saw something: a great and numerous troop of horsemen coming straight from the northeast to slemain mide he went to where ailill and medb and fergus and the nobles of the men of ireland ailill asked tidings of him when he arrived well now mac roth said ailill did you see anyone of the ulstermen on the track of the host today i know not indeed said mac roth but i did see a great and numerous troop of horsemen coming directly from the northeast to slemain mide how many in number are the horsemen said ailill not fewer it seemed to me than thirty hundred chariotfighters armed with spears said mac roth well fergus said ailill why did you try to frighten us just now with the dust and the smoke and the panting of a great army while that is all the battle force you have for us  a little too soon do you disparage them said fergus for perhaps  the army is more numerous than mac roth sayslet us make a good plan swiftly concerning this said medb for  p  line  it was known that yonder huge fierce vehement man would attack us conchobor son of fachtna fthach mac rosa raid meic rudraige the highking of ulster and the son of the high king of ireland let the men of ireland be drawn up in open array to face conchobor with a force of thirty hundred closing it in from the rear and let the men be taken prisoner but not wounded for those who come number no more than the prisoners we need those  need translating st   that is one of the three most satirical sayings of tin b cailnge to suggest that conchobor should be captured unwounded and that the thirty hundred princes of ulster who accompanied him should be taken prisoner should  prisoner translating st   cormac cond longas the son of conchobor heard that and he knew that if he did not take vengeance at once on medb for her boastful speech he would never avenge it until the very end of doom and life then cormac cond longas rose up with his force of thirty hundred to wage war and battle on ailill and medb to meet him rose ailill with his thirty hundred and medb rose with her thirty hundred the maines arose with their thirty hundreds and meic mgach with their thirty hundreds the leinstermen and the munstermen and the people of tara rose up the combatants were separated and each man of them sat down beside the other and near by his weapons nevertheless medb drew up a hollow array to face conchobor with a force of thirty hundred men closing in the rear conchobor came to this array of men and in no wise sought a way of entry but cut a breach broad enough for a soldier opposite his face and his countenance and cut a breach broad enough for a hundred on his right hand and another breach for a hundred on his left and he turned in on them and wrought confusion in their midst and eight hundred valiant warriors of them fell at his hands then he came from them unwounded and unhurt and took up his station in slemain mide waiting for the ulstermen  come now ye men of ireland said ailill let some one of us go to reconnoitre the broad plain of meath to find out in what fashion the ulstermen come to the hill in slemain mide and to give us an account of their arms and equipment their heroes and soldiers and their battlechampions and the people of their land to listen to him will be all the more pleasant for us now who should go there asked they all who but mac roth the chief messenger said ailill  p  line  mac roth came forward and took up his station in slemain mide to await the ulstermen the ulstermen began to muster on that hill and continued doing so from the twilight of early morning until sunset in all that time the ground was hardly bare of them as they came with every division round its king every band round its leader and every king and every leader and every lord with the full number of his own particular forces and his army his muster and his gathering however before the hour of evening sunset all the ulstermen had reached that hill in slemain mide  mac roth came forward to the place where were ailill and medb and fergus and the nobles of the men of ireland bringing an account of the first band ailill and medb asked tidings of him on his arrival well now o mac roth said ailill in what guise and fashion do the men of ulster come to the hill in slemain mide  i know only this indeed said mac roth there came a fierce powerful wellfavoured band on to that hill in slemain mide it seems if one looks at it as if it numbered thirty hundred they all cast off their garments and dug up a mound of turf as a seat for their leader a warrior slender very tall of great stature and of proud mien at the head of that band finest of the princes of the world was he among his troops in fearsomeness and horror in battle and in contention fair yellow hair he had curled wellarranged ringletted cut short his countenance was comely and clear crimson an eager grey eye in his head fierce and aweinspiring a forked beard yellow and curly on his chin a purple mantle fringed fivefolded about him and a golden brooch in the mantle over his breast a pure white hooded shirt with insertion of red gold he wore next to his white skin he carried a white shield ornamented with animal designs in red gold in one hand he had a goldhilted ornamented sword in the other a broad grey spear that warrior took up position at the top of the hill and everyone came to him and his company took their places around him  there came also another band to the same hill in slemain mide said mac roth it numbered almost thirty hundred  it  hundred translating st   a handsome man in the forefront of that same band fair yellow hair he had a bright and very curly beard on his chin a green mantle wrapt around him a pure silver brooch in the mantle over his breast a darkred soldierly tunic with insertion of p  line  red gold next to his fair skin and reaching to his knees a spear like the torch of a royal palace in his hand with bands of silver and rings of gold wonderful are the feats and games performed by that spear in the warriors hand the silvern bands revolve round the golden rings alternately from butt to socket and alternately the golden rings revolve round the silvern bands from socket to thong he bore a smiting shield with scalloped rim on his left side a sword with guards of ivory and ornament of gold thread that warrior sat on the left hand of the warrior who had first come to the hill and his company sat around him but though we say that they sat yet they did not really do so but knelt on the ground with the rim of their shields at their chins in their eagerness to be let at us and yet it seemed to me that the tall fierce warrior who led that company stammered greatly there came still another company to the same hill in slemain mide said mac roth almost the same were they as the preceding one in number and appearance and apparel a handsome broadheaded warrior in the van of that company thick darkyellow hair he had an eager darkblue restless eye in his head a bright and very curly beard forked and tapering on his chin a darkgrey fringed cloak wrapt about him a leafshaped brooch of white bronze in the cloak over his breast a white hooded shirt next to his skin a white shield with animal ornaments of silver he carried a sword with rounded hilt of bright silver in a warlike scabbard at his waist a spear like the pillar of a palace on his back this warrior sat on the turfy mound in front of the warrior who had come first to the hill and his company took up their positions around him but sweeter i thought than the sound of lutes in the hands of expert players was the melodious tone of the voice and speech of that warrior as he addressed the warrior who had come first to the hill and gave him counsel  who are those asked ailill of fergus we know them indeed said fergus the first warrior for whom the sodded mound was cast up on the top of the hill until they all came to him was conchobor mac fachtna fthaig meic rosa raid meic rudraige the highking of ulster and the son of the highking of ireland the great stammering hero who took up his position on the left of conchobor was causcraid mend macha the son of conchobor with the sons of the ulster princes around him and the sons of the kings of ireland who are with him the spear with silver bands and rings of gold that mac roth saw in his hand is called the torch of causcraid it is usual with that spear that the silver  p  line  bands do not revolve the golden rings except shortly before some victory and not at any other time and it is likely that it was just before victory that they revolved just now the handsome broadheaded warrior who sat on the mound in front of the warrior who had first come to the hill was sencha mac ailella meic milchl the eloquent speaker of ulster the man who appeases the armies of the men of ireland o was that said ailill to fergus we know him indeed said fergus the men who came there is the starting of strife a warrior for conflict doom of enemies that was eogan mac durthachta from the north the steadfast ruler of farney  steadfast  farney

bore a duncoloured mantle of curly wool of coloured wool translating st  around him a brooch of white gold in the mantle over his breast a plaited shirt of silk next to his skin a sword with guards of ivory and ornament of thread of gold over his garments on the outside who was that asked ailill of fergus we know him indeed said fergus he that came there is the starting of strife he is the stormy wave which drowns he is a man of three shouts he is the sea pouring over ramparts that was munremur mac gerrcind from modorn in the north there came still another company to the same hill in slemain

instrument which pierces that was connud mac morna from callann in the north  there came yet another company to the same hill in slemain mide said mac roth vigorously and violently in truth did they make for that hill and shook the forces that had arrived there before them a handsome and noble man in the van of that company most beautiful of the men of the world was he in shape and form and make in arms and equipment in size and dignity and honour in figure and valour and proportion that is indeed no lie said fergus that is his fitting description he who came there is no foolish one in

it is they this company will overwhelm you like the sea for it is by reason of this company and the little lad among them that ye will be defeated on this occasion how is that asked ailill not difficult to say answered fergus for this little lad will experience neither fear nor dread when slaying and slaughtering you until he comes to you into the middle of your army the noise of conchobors

battle on the morrows morn there came still another company to the same hill in slemain mide said mac roth which numbered no less than thirty hundred fierce bloodstained warrior bands fair clear blue and crimson men they had long fairyellow hair beautiful brilliant countenances clear kingly eyes shining beautiful garments they wore wonderful golden brooches on their bright hued arms silken finetextured shirts shining blue spears they carried yellow smiting shields goldhilted ornamented swords are set on their thighs loudvoiced care has come to them sad are all the horsemen  sorrowful are the royal leaders orphaned the bright company without their protecting lord who used to defend their borders who are these asked ailill of fergus we know them indeed said fergus they are fierce lions they are champions of battle they are the thirty hundred from mag muirtheimne the reason they are downcast sorrowful and joyless is because their territorial king is not among them namely c chulainn the restraining victorious redsworded triumphant one they have good cause said madb to be downcast sorrowful and joyless for there is no evil we have not wrought on them we have plundered them and we have ravaged them from the monday at the beginning of samain until the beginning of spring we have carried off their women and their sons and their youths their horses and their steeds their herds and their flocks and their cattle we have cast down their hills behind them on to their slopes until they were of equal height you have no reason to boast over them medb said fergus for you did no harm or wrong to them that the leader of that goodly band  p  line  yonder has not avenged on you since every mound and every grave every tomb from here to the eastern part of ireland is a mound and a grave a tombstone and a tomb for some goodly hero or for some brave warrior who fell by the valiant leader of yonder band fortunate is he whom they will uphold woe to him whom they will oppose they will be as much as half a battle force against the men of ireland when they defend their lord in the battle tomorrow morning i heard a great outcry there said mac roth to the west of the battle or to the east of the battle what outcry was that asked ailill of fergus we know it indeed said fergus that was c chulainn trying to come to the battle when he was being laid prostrate on his sickbed in fert sciach with wooden hoops and restraining bands and ropes holding him down for the ulstermen allow him not to come there because of his wounds and gashes for he is unfit for battle and combat after his fight with fer diad  it was as fergus said that was c chulainn being laid prostrate on his sickbed in fert sciach held down with hoops and restraining bands and ropes  then there came out of the encampment of the men of ireland two female satirists called fethan and collach and they pretended to weep and lament over c chulainn telling him that the ulstermen had been routed and that conchobor had been killed and that fergus had fallen in the fight against them  it was on that night that the morrgu daughter of ernmas came and sowed strife and dissension between the two encampments on either side and she spoke these words: crennait braingap: rhetoric untranslatedextent:  lines  she whispered to the erainn that they will not fight the battle which lies ahead  then said c chulainn to leg mac riangabra: alas for you my friend leg if between the two battle forces today anything should be done that you would not find out for me whatsoever i shall find out concerning it little c said leg shall be told to you but see a little flock coming from the west out of the encampment now on to the plain there is a band of youths after them to check and hold them see too a band of youths  p  line  coming from the east out of the encampment to seize them that is true indeed said c chulainn it is the omen of a mighty combat and a cause of great strife the little flock will go across the plain and the youths from the east will encounter those from the west and  west translating st   it was as c chulainn said: the little flock went across the plain and the youths met who gives battle now my friend leg asked c chulainn the people of ulster said leg that is the youths how do they fight asked c chulainn bravely do they fight said leg as for the champions who come from the east to the battle they will make a breach through the battleline to the west as for the champions from the west they will make a breach through the battleline to the east alas that i am not strong enough to go afoot among them for if i were my breach too would be clearly seen there today like that of the rest nay then little c said leg it is no disgrace to your valour and no reproach to your honour you have done bravely hitherto and you will do bravely hereafter well now friend leg said c chulainn rouse the ulstermen to the battle now for it is time for them to go there leg came and roused the ulstermen to the battle and he spoke these words: comeirget rg macha mrglonnaig gap: rhetoric untranslatedextent:  lines   then all the ulstermen rose together at the call of their king and at the behest of their lord and to answer the summons of leg mac riangabra and they all arose stark naked except for their weapons which they bore in their hands each man whose tent door faced east would go westwards through his tent deeming it too long to go around  how do the men of ulster rise for battle now friend leg asked c chulainn bravely do they rise answered leg all are stark naked each man whose tentdoor faces east rushed westwards through his tent deeming it too long to go around i pledge my word said c chulainn that their rising around conchobor now in the early morn is speedy help in answer to a call of alarm  then said conchobor to sencha mac ailella: good my master sencha hold back the men of ulster and do not let them come to the battle until omens and auguries are strongly in their favour and until the sun rises into the vaults of heaven and fills the glens and slopes the hills and mounds of ireland there they remained  p  line  until a good omen was strengthened and sunshine filled the glens and slopes and hills and mounds of the province good my master sencha said conchobor rouse the men of ulster for battle for it is time for them to go sencha roused the men of ulster for the fight and he spoke the words: comeirget rig macha gap: rhetoric untranslatedextent:  lines   not long was leg there when he saw all the men of ireland rising together and taking up their shields and their spears and their swords and their helmets and driving the troops before them to the battle the men of ireland began each of them to strike and smite to hew and cut to slay and slaughter the others for a long space of time then c chulainn asked leg his charioteer when a bright cloud covered the sun: how are they fighting the battle now my friend leg bravely they fight said leg if we were to mount i into my chariot and en the charioteer of conall into his chariot and if we were to go in two chariots from one wing of the army to the other along the tips of their weapons not a hoof nor a wheel nor an axle nor a shaft of those chariots would touch the ground so densely so firmly and so strongly are their weapons held in the hands of the soldiers now alas that i have not the strength to be among them said c chulainn for if i had my attack would be clearly seen there today like that of the rest nay then little c said leg it is no disgrace to your valour and no reproach to your honour you have done bravely hitherto and you will do bravely hereafter  then the men of ireland began again to strike and smite to hew and cut to slay and slaughter the others for a long space and time there came to them then the nine chariotfighters of the warriors of irad and the three men on foot together with them and the nine chariotriders were no swifter than the three on foot  then there came to them also the ferchuitredaig the triads of the men of ireland and their sole function in the battle was to slay conchobor if he should be defeated and to rescue ailill and medb if it were they who were overcome and these are the names of the triads: the three conaires from slab mis the three lussins of lachair the three niad choirbb from tilach loiscthe the three delfhers from dell the three dmaltachs from loch dergdergc the three bodars from the river bas the three beths from the river buaidnech the three bageltachs of mag mbreg the three suibnes from the

fintans from magh femen the three rtanachs from mag raigne the three srchorachs of suide laigen the three etarscels of etarbn the three aeds from mag n aidne the three guaires from gabail then said medb to fergus: it were indeed fitting for you to give us your aid unstintingly in fighting today for you were banished from your territory and your land and with us you got territory and land and estate and much kindness was shown to you if i had my sword today said fergus i would cut them down so that the trunks of men would be piled high on the trunks of men and arms of men piled high on arms of men and the crowns of mens heads piled on the crowns of mens heads and mens heads piled on the edges of shields and all the limbs of the ulstermen scattered by me to the east and to the west would be as numerous as hailstones between two dry fields  along which a kings horses drive if only i had my sword then said ailill to his own charioteer fer loga: bring me quickly the sword that wounds mens flesh o fellow i pledge my word that if its condition and preservation be worse with you today than on the day when i gave it to you on the hillside at crachna a even if the men of ireland and of alba are protecting you against me today not all of them will save you fer loga came forward and brought the sword in all the beauty of its fair preservation shining bright as a torch and the sword was given into ailills hand and ailill gave the sword to fergus and fergus welcomed the sword: welcome to you o caladbolg the sword of leite said he weary are the champions of the wargoddess on whom shall i ply this sword asked fergus on the hosts that surround you on all sides said medb let none receive mercy or quarter from you today except a true friend then fergus seized his arms and went forward to the battle ailill seized his arms medb seized her arms and came to the battle and three times they were victorious in the battle northwards until a phalanx and swords  p  line  forced them to retreat again conchobor heard from his place in the battleline that the battle had three times gone against him in the north then he said to his people the intimate household of the crebrad: take up for a short time my men the position in which i am so that i may go and see who is thus victorious three times to the north of us then said his household: we shall do so for heaven is above us and earth beneath us and the sea all around us and unless the firmament with its showers of stars fall upon the surface of the earth or unless the bluebordered fishabounding sea come over the face of the world or unless the earth quake we shall never retreat one inch from this spot until such time as you come back to us again conchobor came forward to where he had heard the rout of battle against him three times in the north and against the shield the chan conchobuir with its four golden corners and its four coverings of red gold then fergus gave three strong warlike blows on the chan conchobuir and conchobors shield groanedwhenever conchobors shield groaned the shields of all the ulstermen groanedstrongly and violently as fergus struck conchobors shield even as stoutly and as bravely did conchobor hold the shield so that the corner of the shield did not even touch conchobors ear  alas my men said fergus who holds his shield against me today in this day of conflict where the four great provinces of ireland meet at girech and ilgirech in the battle of the foray of cailnge there is a man here younger and mightier than you and whose father and mother were nobler one who banished you from your land and territory and estate one who drove you to dwell with deer and hare and fox one who did not permit you to hold even the length of your own stride in your land and territory one who made you dependent on a woman of property one who outraged you on one occasion by slaying the three sons of usnech despite your safeguard one who today will ward you off in the presence of the men of ireland namely conchobor mac fachtna fthaig meic rossa raid meic rudraigi the high king of ulster and the son of the high king of ireland  that has befallen me indeed said fergus and fergus grasped the caladbolg in both hands and swung it back behind him so that its point touched the ground and his intent was to strike three terrible and warlike blows on the ulstermen so that their dead might outnumber their living cormac cond longas the son of conchobor saw him and he rushed towards fergus and  p  line  clasped his two arms about himready yet not ready  my master fergus hostile and not friendly is that my master fergus ungentle but not heedful  is that my master fergus do not slay and destroy the ulsterman with your mighty blows but take thought for their honour on this day of battle today begone from me lad said fregus for i shall not live if i strike not my three mighty warlike blows upon the ulstermen today so that their living outnumber their dead turn your hand level said cormac cond longas and strike off the tops of the hills over the heads of the hosts and that will appease your anger tell conchobor to come then into his battleposition conchobor came to his place in the battle  now that sword the sword of fergus was the sword of leite from the elfmounds when one wished to strike with it it was as big as a rainbow in the airthen fergus turned his hand level above the heads of the hosts and cut off the tops of the three hills which are still there in the marshy plain as evidence those are the three mela of meath  now as for c chulainn when he heard the chan conchobuir being struck by fergus mac rig he said: come now my friend leg who will dare thus to smite the chain of conchobor my master while i am alive this huge sword as big as a rainbow sheds blood increase of slaughter said leg it is the hero fergus mac rig the chariot sword was hidden in the fairy mounds the horsemen  of my master conchobor have reached the battlefield  loosen quickly the wooden hoops over my wounds fellow said c chulainn then c chulainn gave a mighty spring and the wooden hoops flew from him to mag taga in connacht the bindings of his wounds went from him to bacca in corco mruad the dry wisps of tow which plugged his wounds soared into the uppermost air and firmament as high as larks soar on a day of fair weather when there is no wind his wounds broke out afresh and the trenches and furrows in the earth were filled with his blood and the tents from his wounds the first exploit which c chulain performed after rising from his sickbed was against the two female satirsts fethan and colla who had been feigning to weep and lament over him he dashed their two heads together so that he was red with their blood and grey with their brains none of his weapons had been left beside him save only  p  line  his chariot and he took his chariot on his back and came towards the men of ireland and with his chariot he smote them until he reached the spot where fergus mac rig stood turn hither my master fergus said c chulainn fergus did not answer for he did not hear him c chulainn said again: turn hither my master fergus or if you do not i shall grind you as a mill grinds goodly grain i shall belabour you as flaxheads  are belaboured in a pool i shall entwine you as a woodbine  entwines trees i shall swoop on you as a hawk swoops on little birds that has befallen me indeed said fergus who will dare to speak those proud warlike words to me here where the four great provinces of ireland meet at girech and ilgirech in the battle of the foray of cailnge your own fosterson said c chulainn and the fosterson of conchobor and of the rest of the men of ulster c chulainn mac sualtaim and you promised that you would flee before me when i should be wounded bloody and pierced with stabs in the battle of the tin for i fled before you in your own battle on the tin fergus heard that and be turned and took three mighty heroic strides and when he turned all the men of ireland turned and were routed westwards over the hill the conflict was centred against the men of connacht at midday c chulainn had come to the battle it was sunset in the evening when the last band of the men of connacht fled westwards over the hill by that time there remained in c chulainns hand only a fistful of the spokes around the wheel and a handful of shafts around the body of the chariot but he kept on slaying and slaughtering the four great provinces of ireland during all that time  then medb covered the retreat of the men of ireland and she sent the donn cailnge around to crachu together with fifty of his heifers and eight of medbs messengers so that whoever might reach crachu or whoever might not at least the donn cailnge would arrive there as she had promised then her issue of blood came upon medb and she said: fergus cover the retreat of the men of ireland that i may pass my water by my conscience said fergus it is illtimed and it is not right to do so yet i cannot but do so said medb for i shall not live unless i do fergus came then and covered the retreat of the men of ireland medb passed her water and it made three great trenches in each of which a household can fit hence the place is called fal medba  p  line  c chulainn came upon her thus engaged but he did not wound her for he used not to strike her from behind grant me a favour today c chulainn said medb what favour do you ask said c chulainn that this army may be under your protection and safeguard till they have gone westwards past th mr i grant it said c chulainn c chulainn came around the men of ireland and covered the retreat on one side of them to protect them the triads of the men of ireland came on the other side and medb came into her own position and covered their retreat in the rear in that fashion they took the men of ireland westwards past th mr  then c chulainns sword was given to him and he smote a blow on the three blunttopped hills at th luain as a counterblast to the three mela mide and cut off their three tops  then fergus began to survey  survey reading st  the host as they went westwards from th mr this day was indeed a fitting one for those who were led by a women said fergus gap: text untranslatedextent:  words said medb to fergus this host has been plundered and despoiled today as when a mare goes before her band of foals into unknown territory with none to lead or counsel them so this host has perished today as for medb she gathered and assembled the men of ireland to crachu that they might see the combat of the bulls  as for the donn cailnge when he saw the beautiful strange land he bellowed loudly three times the findbennach of a heard him because of the findbennach no male animal between the four fords of all mag a namely th moga and th coltna th slissen and th m bercha dared utter a sound louder than the lowing of a cow the findbennach tossed his head violently and came forward to crachu to meet the donn cailnge  then the men of ireland asked who should be an eyewitness for the bulls and they all decided that it should be bricriu mac garbadaa year before these events in the foray of cailnge bricriu had come from one province to another begging from fergus and fergus had retained him in his service waiting for his chattels and wealth and a quarrel arose between him and fergus as they were playing chess and bricriu spoke very insultingly to fergus fergus struck him with his fist and with the chessman that he held in his hand and drove the chessman into  p  line  his head and broke a bone in his skull while the men of ireland were on the hosting of the tin bricriu was all that time being cured in crachu and the day they returned from the hosting was the day bricriu rose from his sicknessand the reason they chose bricriu in this manner was because he was no fairer to his friend than to his enemy so bricriu was brought to a gap in front of the bulls each of the bulls caught sight of the other and they pawed the ground and cast the earth over them they dug up the ground and threw it over their shoulders and their withers and their eyes blazed in their heads like distended balls of fire their cheeks and nostrils swelled like smiths bellows in a forge and each collided with the other with a crashing noise each of them began to gore and to pierce and to slay and slaughter the other then the findbennach a took advantage of the confusion of the donn cailnges journeying and wandering and travelling and thrust his horn into his side and visited his rage on him their violent rush took them to where bricriu stood and the bulls hooves trampled him a mans length into the ground after they had killed him  hence that is called the tragical death of bricriu  cormac cond longas the son of conchobor saw this happening and he took a spear which filled his grasp and struck three blows on the donn cailnge from his ear to his tail no wonderful lasting possession may this chattel be for us said cormac since he cannot repel a calf of his own age donn cailnge heard this for he had human understanding and he attacked the findbennach and for a long time and space they fought together until night fell on the men of ireland and when night fell all the men of ireland could do was to listen to their noise and their uproar  that night the bulls traversed the whole of ireland  not long were the men of ireland there early on the morrow when they saw the donn cailnge coming past crachu from the west with the findbennach a a mangled mass on his antlers and horns the men of ireland arose and they knew not which of the bulls was there well now men said fergus leave him alone if it is the findbennach a and if it is donn cailnge leave him his triumph i swear that what has been done concerning the bulls is but little in comparison with what will be done now  p  line  the donn cailnge arrived he turned his right side to crachu and left there a heap of the liver of the findbennach whence the name crachna e  he came forward to the brink of th mr and there he left the loin of the findbennach whence the name th luain  he came eastwards into the land of meath to th troim and there he left the liver of the findbennach  he tossed his head fiercely and shook off the findbennach over ireland he threw his thigh as far as port lrge he threw his ribcage as far as dublind which is called th clath after that he faced towards the north and recognised the land of cailnge and came towards it there there were women and boys and children lamenting the donn cailnge they saw the forehead of the donn cailnge coming towards them a bulls forehead comes to us they cried hence the name taul tairb ever since  then the donn cailnge attacked the women and boys and children of the territory of cailnge and inflicted great slaughter on them after that he turned his back to the hill and his heart broke like a nut in his breast  so far the account and the story
