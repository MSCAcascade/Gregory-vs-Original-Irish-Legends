bricriu of the evil tongue held a great feast for conchobar mac nessa and for all the ultonians the preparation of the feast took a whole year for the entertainment of the guests a spacious house was built by him he erected it in dun rudraige after the likeness of the palace of the red branch in emain yet it surpassed the buildings of that period entirely for material and for artistic design for beauty of architectureits pillars and frontings splendid and costly its carving and lintelwork famed for magnificence   the house was made on this wise: on the plan of taras meadhall having nine compartments from fire to wall each fronting of bronze thirty feet high overlaid with gold in the fore part of the palace a royal couch was erected for conchobar high above those of the whole house it was set with carbuncles and other precious stones which shone with a lustre of gold and of silver radiant with every hue making night like unto day around it were placed the twelve couches of the twelve heroes of ulster the nature of the workmanship was on a par with the material of the edifice it took a waggon team to carry each beam and the strength of seven ulster men to fix each pole while thirty of the chief artificers of erin were employed on its erection and arrangement   then a balcony was made by bricriu on a level with the couch of conchobar and as high as those of the heroes of valour the  lit soller  the feast of bricriu decorations of its fittings were magnificent windows of glass were placed on each side of it and one of these was above bricrius couch so that he could view the hall from his seat as he knew the ulster men would not suffer him within   when bricriu had finished building the hall and balcony supplying it both with quilts and blankets beds and pillows providing meat and drink so that nothing was lacking neither furnishings nor food he straightway went to emain to meet conchobar and the nobles of ulster   it fell upon a day there was in emain a gathering of the ulster men he was anon made welcome and was seated by the shoulder of conchobar bricriu addressed himself to him as well as to the body of the ulster men come with me quoth bricriu to partake of a banquet with me gladly rejoined conchobar if that please the men of ulster fergus mac rig and the nobles of ulster also made answer: no for if we go our dead will outnumber our living when bricriu has incensed us against each other   if ye come not worse shall ye fare quoth bricriu what then asked conchobar if the ulster men go not with thee i will stir up strife quoth bricriu between the kings the leaders the heroes of valour and the yeomen till they slay one another man for man if they do not come with me to share my feast that we shall not do to please thee quoth conchobar i will stir up enmity between father and son so that it will come to mutual slaughter if i do not succeed in doing so i will make a quarrel between mother and daughter if that does not succeed i will set each of the ulster women at variance so that they come to deadly blows till their breasts become loathsome and putrid sure tis better to come quoth fergus do ye straightway take counsel with the chief ultonians said sencha son of ailill unless we take counsel against this bricriu mischief will be the consequence quoth conchobar   thereupon all the ulster nobles assembled in council in discussing the matter sencha counselled them thus: take hostages from bricriu since ye have to go with him and set eight swordsmen about  the feast of bricriu him so as to compel him to retire from the house as soon as he has laid out the feast furbaide ferbenn son of conchobar brought bricriu reply and showed him the whole matter it is happily arranged quoth bricriu the men of ulster straightway set out from emain host battalion and company under king chieftain and leader excellent and admirable the march of the brave and valiant heroes to the palace chapter ii   the hostages of the braves had gone security on his behalf and bricriu accordingly bethought him how he should manage to set the ulster men at variance his deliberation and selfscrutiny being ended he betook himself to the company of loigaire the triumphant son of connad mac ilach hail now loigaire the triumphant thou mighty mallet of bregia thou hot hammer of meath flamered thunderbolt thou victorious warrior of ulster what hinders the championship of emain being thine alway if i so choose it shall be mine quoth loigaire be thine the sovranty of the braves of erin quoth bricriu if only thou act as i advise i will indeed quoth loigaire   sooth if the champions portion of my house be thine the championship of emain is thine for ever the champions portion of my house is worth contesting for it is not the portion of a fools house quoth bricriu belonging to it is a caldron full of generous wine with room enough for three of the valiant braves of ulster furthermore a sevenyearold boar nought has entered its lips since it was little save fresh milk and fine meal in springtime curds and sweet milk in summer the kernel of nuts and wheat in autumn beef and broth in winter a cowlord full sevenyearold since it was a little calf neither heather nor twigtops have entered its lips nought but sweet milk and herbs meadow hay and corn add to this fivescore cakes of wheat cooked in honey withal fiveandtwenty bushels that is what was supplied for these fivescore cakesfour cakes from each bushel such is the champions portion of my house and since thou art the best hero among the men of ulster it is but just to give it thee and i so wish it by the end  the feast of bricriu of the day when the feast is spread out let thy charioteer get up and it is to him the champions portion will be given among them shall be dead men if it is not done so quoth loigaire bricriu laughed at that for it liked him well   when he had done inciting loigaire the triumphant to enmity bricriu betook himself into the company of conall the victorious hail to thee conall the victorious thou art the hero of victories and of combats great are the victories thou hast already scored over the heroes of ulster by the time the ulster men go into foreign bounds thou art a distance of three days and three nights in advance over many a ford thou protectest their rear when returning so that an assailant may not spring past thee nor through thee nor over thee what then should hinder the champions portion of emain being thine alway though great his treachery with regard to loigaire he showed twice as much in the case of conall the victorious   when he had satisfied himself with inciting conall the victorious to quarrel he hied to the presence of cuchulainn hail to thee cuchulainn thou victor of bregia ie bray thou bright banner of the liffey darling of emain belovd of wives and of maidens for thee today cuchulainn is no nickname for thou art the champion of the ulster men thou wardest off their great feuds and frays thou seekest justice for each man of them thou attainest alone to what all the ulster men fail in all the men of ulster acknowledge thy bravery thy valour and thine achievements surpassing theirs what meaneth therefore thy leaving of the champions portion for some one else of the men of ulster since no one of the men of erin is capable of contesting it against thee by the god of my tribe quoth cuchulainn his head shall he lose whoso comes to contest it with me thereafter bricriu severed himself from them and followed the host as if no contention had been made among the heroes   whereupon they entered the palace and each one occupied his couch therein king prince noble yeoman and young brave the half of the palace was set apart for conchobar and his retinue of valiant ulster heroes the other half was reserved for the ladies of ulster attending on  the feast of bricriu mugan daughter of eochaid fedlech wife of king conchobar the following were those who attended upon conchobar in the forepart of the palace namely fergus mac rig celtchar son of uthechar eogan son of durthact and the two sons of the king namely fiacha and fachaig fergna son of findchim fergus son of leti cscraid thestutteringofmacha son of conchobar sencha son of ailill the three sons of fiachach namely rus and dre and imchad muinremur son of geirrgind

victorious cuchulainn connad son of mornai erc son of fedelmid illand son of fergus fintan son of nial ceternd son of fintan factna son of sencad conla the false ailill the honeytongued bricriu himself the chief ultonian warriors with the body of youths and artistes   while the feast was being spread for them the musicians and players performed the moment bricriu spread the feast with its savouries he was ordered by the hostages to leave the hall they straightway got up with drawn swords in their hands to expel him whereupon bricriu and his followers went out to the balcony arrived at the threshold of the palace he called out that champions portion such as it is is not the portion of a fools house do ye give it to the ulster hero ye prefer for valour he thereupon left them   anon the spencers rose up to serve the food the charioteer of loigaire the triumphant to wit sedlang mac riangabra then rose up and said to the distributors: do ye assign to loigaire the triumphant the champions portion which is by you for he alone is entitled to it before the other young braves of ulster then id mac riangabra charioteer to conall the victorious got up and spake to the like effect and loig mac riangabra spake thus: do ye bring that to cuchulainn it is no disgrace for all the ulster men to give it to him it is he who is most valiant among you thats not true quoth conall the victorious and loigaire the triumphant  the feast of bricriu   they then got up upon the floor and donned their shields and seized their swords at one another they hewed till the half of the palace was an atmosphere of fire with the clash of sword and spearedge the other half one white sheet from the enamel of the shields great alarm gat hold upon the palace the valiant heroes shook conchobar himself and fergus mac rig got furious on seeing the injury and the injustice of two men surrounding one namely conall the victorious and loigaire the triumphant attacking cuchulainn there was no one among the ultonians who dared separate them till sencha spake to conchobar: part the men quoth he for at that period among the ultonians conchobar was a god upon earth   thereupon conchobar and fergus intervened the combatants immediately let drop their hands to their sides execute my wish quoth sencha your will shall be obeyed they responded my wish then quoth sencha is tonight to divide the champions portion there among all the host and after that to decide with reference to it according to the will of ailill mac mgach for it is accounted unlucky among the men of ulster to close this assembly unless the matter be adjudged in cruachan the feasting was then resumed they made a circle round the fire and got jovial and made merry chapter iii   bricriu however and his queen were in their soller from his couch the condition of the palace was observable to him and how things were going on withal he exercised his mind as to how he should contrive to get the women to quarrel as he had likewise incited the men when bricriu had done examining his mind it just chanced as he could have wished that fedelmofthefreshheart came from the palace with fifty women in her train in mood hilarious bricriu observed her coming past him hail to thee tonight wife of loigaire the triumphant fedelmofthefreshheart is no nickname for thee with respect to thine  gloss of the christian scribe  the feast of bricriu excellency of form and of wisdom and of lineage conchobar king of a province of erin is thy father loigaire the triumphant thy husband i should deem it but small honour to thee that any of the ulster women should take precedence of thee in entering the banqueting hall only at thy heel should all ultonian women tread if thou comest first into the hall tonight the sovranty of queenship shalt thou enjoy for ever over all the ladies of ulster fedelm anon takes a leap over three ridges from the hall   thereafter came lendabair daughter of eogan mac derthacht wife of conall the victorious bricriu addressed her and spake: hail to thee lendabair for thee that is no nickname thou art the darling and pet of all mankind on account of thy splendour and of thy lustre as far as thy spouse hath surpassed all the heroes of mankind in valour and in comeliness so far hast thou distinguished thyself above the women of ulster though great the deceit he applied in the case of fedelm he applied twice as much in the case of lendabair   emer came out anon with halfahundred women in her train greeting and hail to thee emer daughter of forgall manach f the tricky or shifty wife of the best wight in erin emer of the fair hair is for thee no nickname erins kings and princes contend for thee in jealous rivalry as the sun surpasseth the stars of heaven so far dost thou outshine the women of the whole world in form and shape and lineage in youth and beauty and elegance in good name and wisdom and address though great his deceit in the case of the other ladies in that of emer he applied thrice as much   the three companies thereupon went out till they met at one spot to wit three ridges from the hall none of them wot that bricriu had incited them one against another to the hall they straightway return even and graceful and easy their carriage on the first ridge scarcely did one of them raise a foot before the other but on the ridge following their steps were shorter and quicker moreover on the ridge next the house it was with difficulty each kept up with the other so they raised their robes to the rounds of their limbs to compete in the attempt to go first into the hall for what bricriu said to each of them regarding  the feast of bricriu the other was that whosoever should first enter should be queen of the whole province the amount of confusion then occasioned by the competition to enter the hall first was as it were the noise of fifty chariots approaching the whole palace shook and the warriors sprang to their arms and made essay to kill one another within   stay quoth sencha they are not enemies who have come it is bricriu who has set aquarrelling the women who have gone out by the god of my tribe unless the hall be closed against them our dead will outnumber our living thereupon the doorkeepers close the doors emer daughter of forgall the wily wife of cuchulainn by reason of her speed outran the others and put her back against the door and straightway called upon the doorkeepers ere the other ladies came so that the men within got up each of them to open for his own wife that she might be the first to come within bad lookout tonight quoth conchobar he struck the silver sceptre that was in his hand against the bronze pillar of the couch and the folks gat seated stay quoth sencha tis not a warfare of arms that shall be held here it will be a warfare of words each woman went out under the protection of her spouse and then followed the ulster womens warofwords the womens war of words   fedelm of the fresh heart wife of loigaire the triumphant made speech: born of a mother in freedom one in rank and in race mine elders sprung from loins that are royal in the beauty of peerless breeding lovely in form i am reckoned and noted for figure and comely fostered in warrior virtues in the sphere of goodly demeanour: loigaires hand allnoble what triumphs it scoreth for ulster ulsters marches from foemen ever equal in strength ever hostile all by himself were they holden: from wounds a defence and protection loigaire more famous than heroes in number of victories greater  the feast of bricriu why should not fedelm the lovely step first in the meadhall so festive shapelier than all other women triumphant and jealous of conquest   thereupon spake lendabair daughter of eogan mac derthacht wife of conall cernach son of amorgen: mine is a mien too of beauty of reason with grace of deportment finely and fairly stepping in front of the women of ulster see me step to the meadhall my spouse and my darling the conall big is his shield and triumphant majestic his gait and commanding up to the spears of the conflict in front of them all as he strideth: back to me comes he proudly with heads in his hands as his trophies swords he getteth together for the clashing in conflict of ulster guardian of every fordway he destroyeth them too at his pleasure fords he defendeth from foemen the wrongful attack he avengeth holdeth himself as a hero upon whom shall be raisd a tombstone: son of amorgen noble his is the courage that speaketh many the arts of the conall and therefore he leadeth the heroes lendabair great is her glory in every ones eye is her splendour why not the first when she enters the hall of a king so queenly   emer daughter of forgall the tricky wife of cuchulainn made speech: i am the standard of women in figure in grace and in wisdom none mine equal in beauty for i am a picture of graces mien full noble and goodly mine eye like a jewel that flasheth figure or grace or beauty or wisdom or bounty or chasteness joy of sense or of loving unto mine has never been likened sighing for me is ultoniaa nut of the heart i am clearly now were i welcoming wanton no husband were yours tomorrow my spouse is the hound of culann and not a hound that is feeble  the feast of bricriu blood from his spear is spurting with lifeblood his sword is dripping finely his body is fashioned but his skin is gaping with gashes wounds on his thigh there are many but nobly his eye looks westward bright is the dome he supporteth and ever red are his eyen red are the frames of his chariot and red are also the cushions fighting from ears of horses and over the breaths of menfolk springing in air like a salmon when he springeth the spring of the heroes rarest of feats he performeth the leap that is birdlike he leapeth bounding oer pools of water he performeth the feat cless nonbair battles of bloody battalions the worlds proud armies he heweth beating down kings in their fury mowing the hosts of the foemen others to crn i liken shamming the travail of women ulsters precious heroes compared with my spouse cuchulainn he unto blood may be likened to blood that is clear and noble they to the scum and the garbage as crn their value i reckon shackled and shaped like cattle as kine and oxen and horses   thus did the men in the hall behave on having heard the laudatory addresses of the womento wit loigaire and conall each sprang into his heros light and broke a stave of the palace at a like level with themselves so that in this way their wives came in moreover cuchulainn upheaved the palace just over against his bed till the stars of heaven were to be seen from underneath the wattle by that opening came his own wife with half a hundred women attendants in her train as  this is a mythic reference to cuchulainn as sunhero  lit feat of nine  some metal of inferior value  emer who is represented as coming from the celtic province of meath alludes to the ultonian couvade she implies those ulster heroes were shams  bodelbae  cowshapes may refer to some old practice of cow worship cf the burghead stones  the feast of bricriu also half a hundred in waiting upon the other twain other ladies could not be compared with emer while no one at all was to be likened unto her spouse thereupon cuchulainn let the palace down till seven feet of the wattle entered the ground the whole dn shook and bricrius balcony was laid flat to the earth in such wise that bricriu and his queen toppled down till they fell into the fosse in the middle of the courtyard among the dogs woe is me cried bricriu as he hastily got up enemies have come into the palace he took a turn round and perceived how it was lopsided and inclined entirely to one side he wrung his hands then betook himself within so bespattered that none of the ulster folk could recognise him from his manner of speech only did they do so   then from off the floor of the house bricriu made speech: alas that i have prepared you a feast o ultonians my house is more to me than all my other possessions upon you therefore it is geis to drink or to eat or to sleep till ye leave my house as ye found it on your arrival thereupon all the valiant ulstermen went out of the house and tried to tug it but they did not raise it so much as that even the wind could pass between it and the earth that matter was a difficulty for the ulstermen i have no suggestion for you quoth sencha save that ye entreat of him who has left it lopsided to set it upright   whereupon the men of ulster told cuchulainn to restore the house to its upright position and bricriu made speech withal: oh king of the heroes of erin if thou set it not straight and erect none in the world can do so all the ulstermen then entreated of cuchulainn to solve the matter that the banqueters might not be lacking for food or for ale cuchulainn got up and anon tried to lift the house at a tug and failed a distortion thereupon gat hold of him whilst a drop of blood was at the root of each single hair and he absorbed his hair into his head so that looked on from above his darkyellow curls seemed as if they had been shorn by scissors and taking upon him the motion of a millstone he strained himself till a warriors foot could find room between each pair of ribs  the feast of bricriu   his natural resources and fiery vigour returned to him and he then heaved the house aloft and set it so that it reached its former level thereafter the consumption of the feast was pleasant to them with the kings and the chieftains on the one side round about conchobar the illustrious the noble highking of ulster moreover the queens were on the other side: mugain aitencaetrech daughter of eochaid fedlech wife of conchobar mac nessa fedelm of the nineshapes daughter of conchobarnine shapes she could assume and each shape more lovely than the other also fedelm of the fair hair another daughter of conchobar wife of loigaire the triumphant findbec daughter

mac durthacht wife of conall the victorious niab daughter of celtchar mac uthechar wife of cormac condlongus son of conchobar it would be overmuch to recount and to declare who of noble dames besides chapter v   once more the hall became a babel of words the women lauding their men then essayed conall and loigaire and cuchulainn to stir up dissension sencha son of ailill got up and shook his sceptre to him the ultonians gave ear and then to restrain the ladies he made speech: i restrain ye ladies of ulster noble in name and in glory cease ye your words of contention lest the mien of men folk be paler in keenness of conflict striving amid vainglorious combat through guile of women meseemeth mens shields are wont to be splintered in frays the hosts of the heroes are oft contending in anger  the feast of bricriu to womans whims it is owing this use and wont among men folk they bruise what theres no upbinding and attack what they have not attained to: heroines gallant and glorious and noble ones i restrain ye   then emer spake and made answer: fitting for me meseemeth to speak as the wife of a hero who combineth in natural union graces of mind and of body since ever his teaching was finished and learning to him came easy  none will be found who will equal his age his growth and his splendour: of a line that is long descended he speaketh with grace and with order a brave and a valiant hero like a fury he fights in the tumult dexterous of aim and so agile and quick and sure at the hunting and find ye a man among men folk a mould that may match with cuchulainn   sooth lady quoth conall the victorious let that famous fellow lit gillie of feats come here that we may inquire of him no quoth cuchulainn i am today weary and done up i will not hold a duel till after i have had food and sleep in sooth that was really so inasmuch as it was the day on which he had fallen in with his steed the grey of macha by the side of the grey linn at sliav fuait on its having come out of the loch cuchulainn crept up to it and put his two hands around the steeds neck till they twain got awrestling and on that wise  here follows an enumeration of cuchulainns feats it is not easy to figure them mentally with accuracy so that we can be sure we know what we are speaking about: word for word they mean:both overbreathfeat applefeat ghost or sprite feat screwfeat catfeat valiantchampions whirlingfeat barbed spear quick stroke mad roar heroes fury wheelfeat swordedgefeat climbing against spikepointed things or places and straightening his body on each of them  the feast of bricriu they made a circuit of erin until on that night cuchulainn came chasing with his steed lit driving horse to emain he got the black sainglenn in like wise from lough dubh sainglenn   it was then cuchulainn spake thus: today have the grey and i visited the great plains of erin namely bregia of meath the seashore marsh of muirthemne macha moy medba currech cleitech cerna lia of linn locharn fea femen fergna urros domnand ros roigne   e and to sleep and to eat it liketh me better than everything by the god of my folk i swear twould be but fun and frolic for me to fight a duel had i my fill of food and of sleep well quoth bricriu this has lasted long enough the feast of bricriu has to be celebrated let meat and drink lit food and ale be got at once and let the womens warfare be put a stop to till the feast be over this was done and it was a pleasant time for them till the end of three days and three nights chapter vi   again it was their hap to quarrel about the champions portion conchobar with the nobles of ulster interposed with the view of settling upon the adjudication of the heroes go to curoi mac dairi the man who will undertake to intervene quoth conchobar it was then he spake: entreat ye of him the hardy in the rede which he dealeth for all men curo mac dairi surpasseth and true the judgment he giveth he is fair not given to falsehood but good and a lover of justice noble in mind and a guestfriend skilful of hand like a hero and like to a high king in leading he will adjudge ye truly to ask him demandeth courage chapter vii  after eg and h which represent a different recension and pass on at once to    the feast of bricriu   i accept that then quoth cuchulainn i agree lit i allow it then quoth loigaire let us go then quoth conall the victorious let horses be brought us and thy chariot yoked o conall quoth cuchulainn woe is me cried conall every one quoth cuchulainn knows well the clumsiness of thy horses and the unsteadiness of thy going and of thy turnout thy chariots movement is most heavy each of the two wheels raiseth turf every way thy big chariot careers so that for the space of a year there is a wellmarked track easily recognised by the warriors of ulster   dost thou hear that loigaire said conall woe is me quoth loigaire but i am not to blame or to reproach i am nimble at crossing fords and more to breast the storm of spears outstripping the warriors of ulster put not on me the precedence of kings till i practise faring before kings and champions against single chariots in strait and difficult places in woods and on confines till the champion of a single chariot essay not to career before me   thereupon loigaire had his chariot yoked and he leapt therein he drove over the plainofthetwoforks over the gapofthewatch over the ford of carpat fergus over the fordofthemrrigan to the rowan meadow of the two oxen in the fews of armagh clithar fidbaidi by the meeting of the four ways past dundalk across mag slicech westwards to the slope of bregia a dim dark heavy mist overtook him confusing him in such wise that it was impossible for him to fare farther on the way let us stay here quoth loigaire to his charioteer until the mist clear up loigaire alighted from his chariot and his gillie put the horses into the meadow that was near at hand   while there the gillie saw a huge giant approaching him not beautiful his appearance: broad of shoulder and fat of mouth with sack eyes and a bristly face ugly wrinkled with bushy eyebrows hideous and horrible and strong stubborn violent and haughty fat and puffing with big sinews and strong forearm bold and audacious and uncouth a shorn black patch of hair on him a dun covering about him a tunic over  the feast of bricriu it to the ball of his rump on his feet old tattered brogues on his back a ponderous club like unto the wheelshaft of a mill   whose horses are these gillie he asked as he gazed furiously at him the horses of loigaire the triumphant yes a fine fellow he and as he thus spake he brought down his club on the gillie and gave him a blow from top to toe the gillie gave a cry whereupon loigaire came up what is this you are doing to the lad asked loigaire tis by way of penalty for damage to the meadow quoth the giant i will come myself then quoth logaire they struggle together  loigaire anon fled till he reached emain after having left his horses and gillie and arms   not long thereafter conall the victorious took the same way and arrived at the plain where the druidical mist overtook loigaire the like hideous black dark cloud overtook conall the victorious so that he was unable to see either heaven or earth conall thereon leapt out and the gillie unharnessed the horses in the same meadow not long thereafter he saw the same giant coming towards him he asked him whose servant he was i am servant to conall the victorious he quoth a good man he quoth the giant as he raised his hands till they gave a blow to the gillie from top to toe the fellow yelled anon came conall he and the giant got to close quarters stronger were the wrestling turns of the giant conall fled as loigaire had done having left behind his charioteer and his horses and came to emain   cuchulainn then went by the same way till he came to the same stead the like dark mist overtook him as fell upon the twain preceding cuchulainn sprang down and laig brought the horses into the meadow he had not long to wait till he saw the same man coming towards him the giant asked him whose servant he was servant companion to cuchulainn a good man he quoth the giant plying him with the club laig yelled anon cuchulainn arrived he and the giant came to close quarters and either pounded the other the giant got worsted he forfeited horses and charioteer and cuchulainn brought along with him  magic  the feast of bricriu his fellows horses charioteers and accoutrements till he reached emain in triumph he gave them to their rightful owners   thine is the champions portion quoth bricriu to cuchulainn well i wot from your deeds ye are not a whit on a par with cuchulainn not true bricriu quoth they for we know it is one of his friends from fary that came to him to play us mischief and deal with us perforce as to the championship we shall not forego our claim on that account the men of ulster with conchobar and fergus failed to effect a settlement they sent them either to go to curoi mac dairi or else to go to cruachan to ailill and to mve chapter viii   thus to the one stead the men of ulster assembled in council concerning the heroes the three alike haughty and overweening the conclusion the ulster nobles in conchobars following arrived at was to accompany the heroes and have the difficulty adjudged at the abode of ailill mac magach and of mve of cruachan ai with reference to the champions portion and the mutual rivalry of the women fine and lovely and majestic the march of the ultonians to cruachan cuchulainn however remained behind the host entertaining the ulster ladies performing nine feats with apples nine with javelins and nine with knives in such wise that one did not interfere with the other   loig mac riangabra then went to speak with him to the featstead and said: you sorry simpleton squinter your valour and bravery have passed away the champions portion has gone from ye the ultonians have reached cruachan long since forsooth we have not at all perceived it my loig yoke us the chariot then quoth cuchulainn loig accordingly yoked it and off they started on their march by that  the scribe of lu was harmonising two written accounts he is not sure which to follow  for the section in square brackets read: then after three days and three nights the ultonians as a body went to be adjudged to ailill mac magach to cruachan aieg and h where this comes at once after   and represents a different recension  the feast of bricriu time the ulstermen had reached magh breg cuchulainn having been incited by his charioteer marched with such speed from dun rudraige the grey of macha and the black sainglenn racing in such wise with his chariot across the whole province of conchobar across sliav fuait the country around the fews and across the plain of bregia that the third chariot arrived first in cruachan   in virtue then of the swiftness and the impetuous speed with which all the valiant ultonians reached cruachan under the lead of conchobar and the body of princes a great shaking seized cruachan till the wararms fell from the partitions to the ground seizing likewise the entire host of the hold till the men in the royal keep were like unto rushes in a stream mve thereupon spake: since the day i took up home in cruachan i have not until now heard thunder there being no clouds thereupon findabair daughter of ailill and of mve went to the soller over the high porch of the hold mother dear she said i see a chariot coming along the plain describe it quoth mve its form appearance and style the colour of the horses how the hero looks and how the chariot courses   truly i see quoth findabair the two horses that are in the chariot two fiery dappled greys alike in colour shape and excellence alike in speed and swiftness prancing side by side ears pricked head erect of high mettle and strangely bounding pace nostril fine mane flowing forehead broad full dappled full slim of girth and broad of chest manes and tails curled they career along a chariot of fine wood with wickerwork having two black revolving wheels and two beautiful pliant reins its fertsi hard and straight as a sword its body of wickerwork new and freshly polished its curved yoke silvermounted two rich yellow looped reins in the chariot a fair man with long curling hair his tresses tricoloured: brown at the skin bloodred at the middle as a diadem of yellow gold the hair at the tips three halos encircle his upturned head each merging into the other about him a soft

in each of his eyes eight red dragon gemstones his two cheeks bluewhite and bloodred he emits sparks of fire and burning breath with a ray of love in his look a shower of pearls me thinketh has fallen into his mouth each of his two eyebrows as black as the side of a black spit on his two thighs rests a goldenhilted sword claideb and fastened to the copper frame of the chariot is a bloodred spear gai with a sharp mettlesome blade on a shaft of wood well fitted to his hand over both his shoulders a crimson shield scath with a rim of silver chased with figures of animals in gold he leaps the heros salmonleap into the air and does many like swift feats besides such is the chief of a chariotroyal before him in that chariot there is a charioteer a very slender tall much freckled man on his head very curly brightred hair with a fillet of bronze upon his brow which prevents the hair from falling over his face on both sides of his head patins or cups of gold confine the hair a shouldermantle about him with sleeves opening at the two  lit black  of five plaits te  the feast of bricriu elbows and in his hand a goad of red gold with which he guides the horses   truly it is a drop before a shower we recognise the man from his description quoth mve an ocean fury a whale that rageth a fragment of flame and fire a bear majestic a grandly moving billow a beast in maddening

hearty one he who is victor fully as fresh malt is ground in the mill shall we be ground by cuchulainn by the god of my people said mve i swear if it be with fury cuchulainn comes to us like as a mill of ten spokes grinds very hard malt so he alone will grind us to mould and gravel should the whole province attend on us in cruachan unless his fury and violence are subdued   how do they come this time quoth mve wrist to wrist and palm to palm tunic to tunic they stand shield to shield and frame to frame a shouldertoshoulder band wood to wood and car to car thus they all fond mother are  a term of contempt for the ordinary soldiers  ie deed  the feast of bricriu as thunder on the roof when breaking with speed the chargers dash as heavy seas which storms are shaking the earth in turn they crash anon it vibrates as they strike their strength and weight are like and like high their name no ill fame then mve made speech: women to meet them and mony in dshabille fullbreasted and bare and bonnie in number weel bring vats of cold water where wanting beds ready for rest fine food bring ye forth and not scanty but of the best strong ale and sound and well malted warriors keep let the gates of the burg be set slanting open the liss hail the battalion thats cantering wont kill us ywis   thereupon mve went out by the high door of the palace into the court thrice fifty maidens in her train with three vats of cold water for the three valiant heroes in front of the hosts in order to alleviate their thirst lit heat choice was straightway given them so as to ascertain whether a house apiece should be allotted them or one house among the three to each a house apart quoth cuchulainn thereafter such as they preferred of the  girls are brought into the house fitted up with beds of surpassing magnificence findabair in preference to any other was brought by cuchulainn into the apartment where he himself was on the arrival of the ultonians ailill and mve with their whole household went and bade them welcome we are pleased quoth sencha son of ailill responding   thereupon the ultonians come into the fort and the palace is left to them as recounted viz seven circles and seven compartments from fire to partition with bronze frontings and carvings of red yew three  the feast of bricriu stripes of bronze in the arching of the house which was of oak with a covering of shingles it had twelve windows with glass in the openings the dais of ailill and of mve in the centre of the house with silver frontings and stripes of bronze round it with a silver wand by the fronting facing ailill that would reach the mid hips of the house so as to check the inmates unceasingly the ulster heroes went round from one door of the palace to the other and the musicians played while the guests were being prepared for such was the spaciousness of the house that it had room for the hosts of valiant heroes of the whole province in the suite of conchobar moreover conchobar and fergus mac rich were in ailills compartment with nine valiant ulster heroes besides great feasts were then prepared for them and they were there until the end of three days and of three nights   thereafter ailill inquired of conchobar with his ultonian following what was the purport of his march sencha narrated the matter on account of which they had come viz the three heroes rivalry as to the champions portion and the ladies rivalry as to precedence at feasts they could not stand being judged anywhere else than here by thee at that ailill was silent and was not in a happy mood indeed quoth he it is not to me this decision should be given as to the champions portion unless it be done from hatred there is really no better judge well said ailill i require time to consider we really require our heroes quoth sencha for great to timid folks is their value for that then three days and three nights suffice for me quoth ailill that would not forfeit friendship answered sencha the ultonians straightway bade farewell being satisfied they left their blessing with ailill and mve and their curse with bricriu for it was he who had incited them to strife they then departed from the territory of mve having left loigaire and conall and cuchulainn to be judged by ailill the like supper as before was given to each of these heroes every night chapter ix  the feast of bricriu   one night as their portion was assigned them three cats from the cave of cruachan were let loose to attack them ie three beasts of magic conall and loigaire made for the rafters having left their food with the beasts in that wise they slept till the morrow cuchulainn fled not from his place from the beast which attacked him but when it stretched its neck out for eating cuchulainn gave a blow with his sword on the beasts head but the blade glided off as twere from stone then the cat set itself down in the circumstances cuchulainn neither ate nor slept as soon as it was early morning the cats were gone in such condition were the three heroes found lit seen on the morrow does not that trial suffice for adjudging ye asked ailill by no means quoth conall and loigaire it is not against beasts we are striving but against men chapter x   ailill having gone to his chamber set his back against the wall he was disquieted in mind for he took the difficulty that faced him to be fraught with danger he neither ate nor slept till the end of three days and three nights coward mve then called him if you dont decide i will difficult for me to adjudge them ailill said it is a misfortune for one to have to do it there is no difficulty quoth mve for loigaire and conall cernach are as different as bronze and findruini conall cernach and cuchulainn as different as findruini and red gold   it was then after she had pondered her advice that loigaire the triumphant was summoned to mve welcome o loigaire the triumphant she quoth it is meet to give thee a champions portion we assign to thee the sovranty of the heroes of erin from this time forth and the champions portion and a cup of bronze with a bird chased in white metal on its bottom in preference to every one else take it with thee as a token of award no one else is to see it till at the days end thou hast come to the red branch of conchobar on the champions  white metal  the feast of bricriu portion being exhibited among you then shalt thou bring forth thy cup in the presence of all the ultonian nobles moreover the champions portion is therein none of the valiant ultonian heroes will dispute it further with thee for the thing thou art to take away with thee shall be a token of genuineness in the estimation of all the ultonians thereupon the cup with its full of luscious wine was given to loigaire the triumphant there and then he quaffs the contents at a draught now you have the feast of a champion quoth mve i wish you may enjoy it a hundred hundred years at the head of all ulster   loigaire thereupon bade farewell then conall cernach in like wise was summoned into the royal presence welcome quoth mve o conall cernach meet it is to give thee a champions portion with a cup of whitemetal besides having a bird on the bottom of it chased in gold thereafter the cup was given to conall with its full of luscious wine   conall bade farewell a herald was then sent to fetch cuchulainn come to speak with the king and queen quoth the messenger cuchulainn at the time was busy playing chess with loig son of riangabair his own charioteer no mocking he quoth you might try your lies on some other fool having hurled one of the chessmen it pierced the centre of the heralds brain he got his deathblow therefrom and fell between ailill and mve woe is me quoth mve sorely doth cuchulainn work on us his fury when his fit of rage is upon him thereupon mve got up and came to cuchulainn and put her two arms round his neck try a lie upon another quoth cuchulainn glorious son of the ultonians and flame of the heroes of erin tis no lie that is to our liking where thou art concerned were all erins heroes to come to thee by preference would we grant the quest for in regard to fame bravery and valour to distinction youth and glory the men of erin acknowledge thy superiority   cuchulainn got up he accompanied mve into the palace and ailill bade him warm welcome a cup of gold was given him full of  lit on the floor of the palace  the feast of bricriu luscious wine and having on the bottom of it birds chased in precious stone with it and in preference to every one else there was given him a lump as big as his eyes twain of dragonstone now you have the feast of a champion quoth mve i wish you may enjoy it a hundred hundred years at the head of all the ultonian heroes moreover it is our verdict quoth ailill and mve inasmuch as thou thyself art not to be compared with the ultonian warriors neither is thy wife to be compared with their women nor is it too much we think that she should always precede all the ultonian ladies when entering the mead hall at that cuchulainn quaffed at one draught the full of the cup and then bade farewell to the king queen and household all chapter xi thereafter he followed his charioteer my plan quoth mve to ailill is to keep those three heroes with us again tonight and to further test them do as thou deemest right quoth ailill the men were then detained and brought to cruachan and their horses unyoked   their choice of food was given them for their horses conall and loigaire told them to give oats two years old to theirs but cuchulainn chose barley grains for his they slept there that night the women were apportioned among them findabair with a train of fifty damsels was brought into the stead of cuchulainn sav the eloquent sadb sulbair another daughter of ailill and of mve with fifty maids in attendance was ushered into the presence of conall cernach conchend daughter of ceit mac magach with fifty damsels along with her was brought into the presence of loigaire the triumphant moreover mve herself was wont to resort to the stead of cuchulainn they slept there that night  this passage in brackets is clearly the work of the compiler of lu the reading in h is: and he went till he arrived at emain macha at the end of day and there was none of the ultonians who would venture to ask news as to any of the three until the time came to eat and to drink in the mead hall the narrative in h passes on to   which seems in sequence  the feast of bricriu   on the morrow they arose early in the morning and went into the house where the youths were performing the wheelfeat then loigaire seized the wheel and tossed it till it reached half up the side wall upon that the youths laughed and cheered him it was in reality a jeer but it seemed to loigaire a shout of applause conall then took the wheel it was on the ground he tossed it as high as the ridgepole of the palace the youths raised a shout at that it seemed to conall it was a shout of applause and of victory to the youths it was a shout of scorn then cuchulainn took the wheelit was in midair he caught it he hurled it aloft till it cast the ridgepole from off the place the wheel went a mans cubit into the ground in the outside enclosure the youths raised a shout of applause and of triumph in cuchulainns case it seemed to cuchulainn however it was a laugh of scorn and of ridicule they then gave vent to   cuchulainn anon sought out the womenfolk and took thrice fifty needles from them these he tossed up one after the other each needle went into the eye of the other till in that wise they were joined together he returned to the women and gave each her own needle into her hand the young braves praised cuchulainn whereupon they bade farewell to the king the queen and household as well chapter xii   go to the abode of my fosterfather and to that of my stepmother quoth mveviz ercol and garmnaand there put up as guests tonight they kept on their way and after running a race at the cruachan gathering thrice did cuchulainn win the victory of the games they then went to the abode of garmna and of ercol who bade them welcome for what are ye come asked ercol to be adjudged by thee they quoth go to the abode of samera he will adjudge ye they went accordingly and guides were sent with them they were welcomed by samera whose daughter buan fell in love with cuchulainn they told samera it was in order to be judged they had come to him samera  the feast of bricriu despatched them as they were lit in their order to the amazons of the glen   loigaire went first but left his accoutrements arms and clothing with them conall also went and left his spears with them but took his chief weapon to wit his sword away with him on the third night cuchulainn went the amazons shrieked at him he and they fought each other till his spear was splintered his shield broken his raiment torn off the amazons were beating and overpowering him o cuchulainn said loig you sorry coward you squinting savage gone are your valour and your bravery when it is sprites that beat you then cuchulainn was enraged at the sprites he turned back upon the horrors and cut and gashed them till the glen was filled with their blood he brought off his companys brave banner with him and turned back in triumph to the seat of samera the place where his companions were   samera bade him welcome twas then he made speech: not right to share the champions fare of the cooking pit fatted kine wellfed swine honey and bread through ladies cunning take not his share from culanns hound of name and fame cleaver of shields raven of prey that bravery wields eager for frayboar of battle as wood takes fire strikes his ire emains foes of victoryloving women belovdplague of death a judge in deeming not in seeming eye flashing far hostile ports where ships resort his tributes know his chariot rides the mountainside pride of his clan he leads the van an eagle of war why to loigaire lion of fences liken him why unto conall rider of fame  ie with the amazons  the feast of bricriu why should not emer of mantle shiningit is our pleasure through grace divining of ultonian ladies highborn and all enter first the merry meadhall cuchulainns share well i wot it is not just elsewhere to allot my verdict to ye then: the champions portion to cuchulainn and to his wife the precedence of the ladies of ultoniacuchulainns valour to rank above that of every one else conchobars excepted   after that they went to the abode of ercol who bade them welcome they slept there that night ercol challenged them to combat with himself and with his horse whereupon loigaire and his horse went against them the gelding of ercol killed the horse of loigaire who was himself overcome by ercol before whom he fled he took his way to emain across assaroe and brought tidings with him of his comrades having been killed by ercol conall likewise fled his horse having been killed by ercols the way he went was across snm rthaind rathands pool on the route to emain moreover conalls gillie rthand was drowned in the river there and after him snm rthaind takes its name since   the grey of macha however killed the horse of ercol and cuchulainn took ercol himself bound behind his chariot along with him to emain buan daughter of samera went on the track of the three chariots she recognised the track of cuchulainns framed chariot inasmuch as it was no narrow track it used to take but undermining walls either enlarging or else leaping over breaches the girl at last leapt a fearful leap following him behind in his chariots track till she struck her forehead on a rock whereof she died from this is named buans grave when conall and cuchulainn reached emain they found the ultonians holding a keen for them inasmuch as they felt certain they were killed such the report loigaire brought they then related their adventures and told their news to conchobar and to the ultonian nobles generally but the chiefs of chariots and the men of valour as a body  the feast of bricriu were reproaching loigaire for the lying story he told concerning his fellows   then cathbath made speech to this effect: a tale inglorious base outlaw black and false for shame thy face from sight ultonias champions portion unhappily didst thou dispute nor won it by right thy lying upset cuchulainn with ercol has coped victor in battlefight tied at the tail of his car hercules strong he held nor do men conceal his feats his great havoc they tell a champion glorious battlevictorious when rageth the fray slaughterhead of the hosts a lord that careers in might zealous of valour and stout with him to dispute the champions portion unworthy a heros repute chapter xiii   the heroes ceased their discussions and their babblings and fell to eating and enjoying themselves it was sualtam mac rig father of cuchulainn himself who that night attended upon the ultonians moreover conchobars laddervat was filled for them their portion having been brought to their presence the spencers came to serve but at the outset they withheld the champions portion from distribution  the feast of bricriu why not give the champions portion quoth duach of the chafer tongue to some one of the heroes those three have not returned from the king of cruachan having no sure token with them whereby the champions portion may be assigned to one of them   thereupon loigaire the triumphant got up and lifted on high the bronze cup having the silver bird chased on the bottom the champions portion is mine he quoth and none may contest it with me it is not quoth conall cernach not alike are the tokens we brought off with us yours is a cup of bronze whereas mine is a cup of white metal findruini from the difference between them the champions portion clearly belongs to me it belongs to neither of you quoth cuchulainn as he got up and spoke ye have brought no token that procures you the champions portion yet the king and queen whom ye visited were loath in the thick of distress to intensify the strife but no less than your deserts have ye received at their hands the champions portion remains with me seeing i brought a token distinguished above the rest   he then lifted on high a cup of red gold having a bird chased on the bottom of it in precious dragonstone the size of his eyes twain all the ultonian nobles in the suite of conchobar mac nessa saw it therefore it is i he quoth who deserve the champions portion provided i have fair play to thee we all award it quoth conchobar and fergus and the ulster nobles as well by the verdict of ailill and of mve the champions portion is yours i swear by my peoples god said loigaire and conall the victorious that the cup you have brought is purchased of the jewels and of the treasures in your possession have you given to ailill and to mve for it in order that a defeat might not be on record against you and that the champions portion might be given to no one else in preference by my peoples god that judgment shall not stand the champions portion shall not be yours they then sprang up one after the other their swords drawn straightway conchobar and fergus intervened whereupon they let down their hands and sheathed their swords hold quoth sencha do as i bid we will they quoth  the feast of bricriu chapter xiv   go forth to the ford of yellow son of fair he will adjudge ye accordingly the three heroes went to the abode of yellow budi they told their wants and the rivalries which brought them was not judgment given you in cruachan by ailill and by mve said yellow in sooth there was quoth cuchulainn but those fellows dont stand by it stand by it quoth the other men we will not what has been given us is no decision at all it is not easy for another to adjudge ye then quoth yellow seeing ye did not abide by mve and ailills arrangement i know he continued one who will venture it viz terror son of great fear uath mac imomain at yonder loch off then in quest of him he will adjudge ye a big powerful fellow was terror son of great fear he used to shift his form into what shape he pleased was wont to do tricks of magic and such like arts he in sooth was the wizard from whom muni the wizards pass is named he used to be called wizard from the extent to which he changed his divers shapes   to terror at his loch they accordingly went yellow had given them a guide to terror they told the cause for which they had sought him out he said he should venture on adjudgment provided only they would adhere to it we will adhere to it they quoth whereupon he solemnly pledges them i have a covenant to make with you he quoth and whoever of you fulfils it with me he is the man who wins the champions portion what is the covenant they said i have an axe and the man into whose hands it shall be put is to cut off my head today i to cut off his tomorrow   thereupon conall and loigaire said they would not agree to that arrangement for it would be impossible for them to live after having been beheaded although he might therefore they declined shirked that: although other books narrate that they agreed to the bargain to wit loigaire to cut off terrors uaths head the first day and on the giants returning that loigaire shirked his part of the  the feast of bricriu bargain and that conall likewise behaved unfairly cuchulainn however said he would agree to the covenant bargain were the champions portion given to him conall and loigaire said they would allow him that if he agreed to a wager with terror cuchulainn solemnly pledged them not to contest the champions portion if he made covenant with terror and they then pledged him to ratify it terror having put spells on the edge of the axe lays his head upon the stone for cuchulainn cuchulainn with his own axe gives the giant a blow and cuts off his head he then went off from them into the loch his axe and his head on his breast   on the morrow he comes back on his quest cuchulainn stretches himself out for him on the stone the axe with its edge reversed he draws down thrice on cuchulainns neck get upquoth terror the sovranty of the heroes of erin to cuchulainn and the champions portion without contest the three heroes then hied them to emain but loigaire and conall disputed the verdict given in favour of cuchulainn and the original contest as to the champions portion continued the ultonians advised them to go for judgement unto curoi to that too they agreed chapter xv   on the morning of the morrow the three heroes cuchulainn conall and loigaire then set off to fort curoi they unyoked their chariot at the gate of the hold then entered the court whereupon blathnat minds daughter wife of curoi mac dairi bade them warm welcome that night on their arrival curoi was not at home but knowing they would come he counselled his wife regarding the heroes until he should return from his oriental expedition into scythian territory from the age of seven years when he took up arms until his  evidently an interpolation of the compiler of lu he expressly refers to other books araili libair  the feast of bricriu demise curoi had not reddened his sword in erin nor ever had the food of erin passed his lips nor could erin contain him for his haughtiness renown and rank overbearing fury strength and gallantry his wife acted according to his wish in the matter of bathing and of washing providing them with refreshing drinks and beds most excellent and it liked them well   when bedtime was come she told them that each was to take his night watching the fort until curoi should return and moreover thus said curoithat ye take your turn watching according to seniority in what airt soever of the globe curoi should happen to be every night oer the fort he chaunted a spell till the fort revolved as swiftly as a millstone the entrance was never to be found after sunset   the first night loigaire the triumphant took the sentry inasmuch as he was the eldest of the three as he kept watch into the later part of the night he saw a giant scath approaching him far as his eyes could see from the sea westwards exceeding huge and ugly and horrible he thought him for in height it seemed to him he reached unto the sky and the sheen broad expanse of the sea was visible between his legs thus did he come his hands full of stripped oaks each of which would form a burden for a waggonteam of six at whose root not a stroke had been repeated after the single swordstroke one of the stakes he cast at loigaire who let it pass him twice or thrice he repeated it but the stake reached neither the skin nor the shield of loigaire then loigaire hurled a spear at him and it hit him not   the giant stretched his hand towards loigaire such its length that it reached across the three ridges that were between them as they were throwing at each other and thus in his grasp he seized him though loigaire was big and imposing he fitted like a year old into the clutch of his opponent who then ground him in his grasp as a chessman is turned in a groove in that state halfdead the giant tossed him out over the fort till he fell into the mire of the fosse at the palacegate the fort had no opening there and the other men and inmates of the hold  lit between his two palms  the feast of bricriu thought he had leapt outside over the fort as a challenge for the other men to do likewise   there they were until the days end when the nightwatch began conall went out on sentry for he was older than cuchulainn everything occurred as it did to loigaire the first night the third night cuchulainn went on sentry lit into the seat of watch that night the three goblins greys of sescind uairbeoil the three oxfeeders  of bregia and the three sons of bigfist the siren met by appointment to plunder the hold this too was the night of which it was foretold that the spirit of the lake by the fort would devour the whole host of the hold man and beast   cuchulainn while watching through the night had many uneasy forebodings when midnight was come he heard a terrific noise drawing nigh to him holloa holloa cuchulainn shouted who is there if friends they be let them not stir if foes let them flee then they raised a terrific shout at him whereupon cuchulainn sprang upon them so that the nine of them fell dead to the earth he heaped their heads in disorder into the seat of watching and resumed sentry another nine shouted at him in like manner he killed the three nines making one cairn of them heads and accoutrements   while he was there far on into the night tired and sad and weary he heard the rising of the loch on high as it were the booming of a very heavy sea how deep soever his dejection his spirit could not brook his not going to see what caused the great noise he heard he then perceived the upheaving monster and it seemed to him to be thirty cubits in curvature above the loch it raised itself on high into the air sprang towards the fort opened its mouth so that one of the palaces could go into its gullet   then he called to mind his swooping feat sprang on high and was as swift as a winnowing riddle right round the monster he entwined his two arms about its neck stretched his hand till it reached into its gullet tore out the monsters heart and cast it from him on the ground then the beast fell from the air till it rested on the earth having sustained a blow on the shoulder cuchulainn then plied it with his  the feast of bricriu sword hacked it to atoms and took the head with him into the sentryseat along with the other heap of skulls   while there depressed and miserable in the morning dawn he saw the giant approaching him westwards from the sea bad night says he twill be worse for you you uncouth fellow quoth cuchulainn then the giant cast one of the branches at cuchulainn who let it pass him he repeated it two or three times but it reached neither the skin nor the shield of cuchulainn cuchulainn then hurled his spear at the giant but it reached him not whereupon the giant stretched his hand towards cuchulainn to grip him as he did the others cuchulainn leapt the heros salmon leap and called to mind his swoopingfeat with his drawn sword over the monsters head as swift as a hare he was and in midair circling round the monster till he confused it by making it giddy lit till he made a water wheel of him life for life o cuchulainn he quoth give me my triad of wishes quoth cuchulainn at a breath they are thine he said the sovranty of erins heroes be henceforth mine the champions portion without dispute the precedence to my wife oer ultonias ladies forever it shall be thine he at once quoth then he who had been conversing with him vanished he knew not whither   he then mused within himself as to the leap his fellows leapt over the fort for their leap was big and broad and high moreover it seemed to him it was by leaping it that the valiant heroes had gone over it he essayed it twice and failed alas cuchulainn quoth my exertions hitherto about the champions portion have exhausted me and now i lose it through being unable to take the leap the others took as  the circling motion of a bird of prey suggests itself  it thou hast them as they will come to thee with thy breath the three things were to be got for asking provided they were asked at one breath thus too they were incitements to strife in a welsh fairy story also a woman gets all the animals she can count at one breath  the feast of bricriu he thus mused he essayed the following feats: he would keep springing backwards in midair a shots distance from the fort and then he would rebound from there until his forehead would strike the fort anon he would spring on high till all that was within the fort was visible to him while again he would sink up to his knees in the earth owing to the pressure of his vehemence and violence at another time he would not take the dew from off the tip of the grass by reason of his buoyancy of mood vehemence of nature and heroic valour what with the fit and fury that raged upon him he stepped over the fort outside and alighted in the middle at the door of the palace his two footprints are in the flag on the floor of the hold at the spot where was the royal entrance he thereafter entered the house and heaved a sigh   then minds daughter blthnat wife of curoi made speech: truly not the sigh of one dishonoured but a victors sigh of triumph the daughter of the king of the isle of the men of falga knew full well of cuchulainns evil plight that night they were not long there when they beheld curoi coming towards them carrying into the house with him the standard of the three nines slain by cuchulainn along with their heads and that of the monster he put the heads from off his breast on to the floor of the stead and spoke: the gillie whose one nights trophies are these is a fit lad to watch a kings keep for aye the champions portion over which you have fallen out with the gallant youths of erin truly belongs to cuchulainn the bravest of them were he here could not match him in number of trophies curois verdict upon them was: the champions portion to be cuchulainns with the sovranty of valour oer all the gael and to his wife the precedence on entering the mead hall before all the ladies of ultonia and seven cumals of gold and of silver he gave him in reward for his one nights performance  a cumal had the value of three cows  the feast of bricriu   they straightway bade curoi farewell and kept on till they gat seated in emain ere the day closed when the spencers came to deal and to divide they took the champions portion with its share of ale out of the distribution that they might have it apart sooth sure are we quoth duach of the chafer tongue ye think not tonight of contending as to the champions portion the man ye sought out mayhap has undertaken your adjudging whereupon quoth the other folk to cuchulainn: the champions portion was not assigned to one of you in preference to the other as to curois judgment also upon those three not a whit did he concede to cuchulainn upon their arriving at emain cuchulainn then declared he by no means coveted the winning of it for the loss thence resulting to the winner would be on a par with the profit got from it the championship was therefore not fully assigned until the advent of the champions covenant in emain chapter xvi the champions covenant   once upon a time as the ultonians were in emain fatigued after the gathering and the games conchobar and fergus mac rig with ultonias nobles as well proceeded from the sporting field outside and gat seated in the royal court lit red branch of conchobar neither cuchulainn nor conall the victorious nor loigaire the triumphant were there that night but the hosts of ultonias valiant heroes were there as they were seated it being eventide and the day drawing towards the close they saw a big uncouth fellow of exceeding ugliness drawing nigh them into the hall to them it seemed as if none of the ultonians would reach half his height horrible and ugly was the carles guise next his skin he wore an old hide with a dark dun mantle around him and over him a great spreading clubtree branch the size of a wintershed under which thirty bullocks could find shelter ravenous yellow eyes he had protruding from his head each of the twain the size of an oxvat each finger as thick as another persons wrist in his left hand a stock a  the feast of bricriu burden for twenty yoke of oxen in his right hand an axe weighing thrice fifty glowing molten masses of metal its handle would require a ploughteam a yoke of six to move it its sharpness such that it would lop off hairs the wind blowing them against its edge   in that guise he went and stood by the forkbeam beside the fire is the hall lacking in room for you quoth duach of the chafer tongue to the uncouth clodhopper that ye find no other place than by the forkbeam unless ye wish to be domestic luminaryonly sooner will a blaze be to the house than brightness to the household what property soever may be mine sooth ye will agree no matter how big i am that the household as a whole will be enlightened while the hall will not be burnt   that however is not my sole function i have others as well but neither in erin nor in alba nor in europe nor in africa nor in asia including greece scythia the isles of gades the pillars of hercules and bregons tower brigantium have i found the quest on which i have come nor a man to do me fairplay regarding it since ye ultonians have excelled all the folks of those lands in strength prowess valour in rank magnanimity dignity in truth generosity and worth get ye one among you to give me the boon i crave   in sooth it is not just that the honour of a province be carried off quoth fergus mac rich because of one man who fails in keeping his word of honour death certainly is not a whit nearer to him than to you not that i shun it quoth he make thy quest known to us then quoth fergus mac rich if but fairplay be vouchsafed me i will tell it it is right also to give fairplay quoth sencha son of ailill for it beseemeth not a great clannish folk to break a mutual covenant over any unknown individual to us too it seemeth likely if at long last you find such a person you will find here one worthy of you conchobar i put aside he quoth for sake of his sovranty and fergus mac rich also on account of his like privilege these two excepted come whosoever of you  the feast of bricriu that may venture that i may cut off his head tonight he mine tomorrow night   sure then there is no warrior here quoth duach after these two by my troth there will be this moment quoth fatneck son of short head as he sprang on to the floor of the hall the strength then of yon fat neck was as the strength of a hundred warriors each arm having the might of a hundred centaurs bend down bachlach quoth fatneck that i may cut your head off to night you to cut off mine tomorrow night were that my quest i could have got it anywhere quoth the bachlach let us act according to our covenant he quoth i to cut off your head tonight you to avenge it to morrow night by my peoples god quoth duach of the chafer tongue death is thus for thee no pleasant prospect should the man killed tonight attack thee on the morrow it is given to you alone if you have the power being killed night after night lit to be killed every night to avenge it next day truly i will carry out what you all as a body agree upon by way of counsel strange as it may seem to you quoth the bachlach he then pledged the other to keep his troth in this contention as to fulfilling his tryst on the morrow   with that fatneck took the axe from out of the bachlachs hand seven feet apart were its two angles then did the bachlach put his neck across the block fatneck dealt a blow across it with the axe till it stuck in the block underneath cutting off the head till it lay by the base of the forkbeam the house being filled with the blood straightway the bachlach rose recovered himself clasped his head block and axe to his  lu ends tale continued by edinburgh ms in this clause lu eg and ed were at one but there is no confusion in the tale for according to   the giant agrees to be beheaded first and this form of the giants covenant is resumed in   and continued to the end the giant in   is dissembling for the nonce his real mind is seen from    you do not care for death then if the man whom you slay tonight clings to you on the morrow professor kuno meyer renders it thus but i take this clause to be addressed to fatneck the following to the giant  the natural plan would be to behead the giant the first night it is on this the story turns it is what seemeth strange it thus becomes clear he is a supernatural being  the feast of bricriu breast thus made his exit from the hall with blood streaming from his neck it filled the red branch on every side great was the folks horror wondering at the marvel that had appeared to them by my peoples god quoth duach of the chafer tongue if the bachlach having been killed tonight come back tomorrow he will not leave a man alive in ultonia the following night however he returned and fatneck shirked him then began the bachlach to urge his pact with fatneck sooth it is not right for fatneck not to fulfil his covenant with me   that night however loigaire the triumphant was present who of the warriors that contest ultonias champions portion will carry out a covenant tonight with me where is loigaire the triumphant quoth he here said loigaire he pledged him too yet loigaire kept not his tryst the bachlach returned on the morrow and similarly pledged conall cernach who came not as he had sworn   the fourth night the bachlach returned and fierce and furious was he all the ladies of ultonia came that night to see the strange marvel that had come into the red branch that night cuchulainn was there also then the fellow began to upbraid them ye men of ultonia your valour and your prowess are gone your warriors greatly covet the champions portion yet are unable to contest it where is yon poor mad wight that is hight cuchulainn fain would i know if his word be better than the others no covenant do i desire with you quoth cuchulainn likely is that you wretched fly greatly thou dost fear to die whereupon cuchulainn sprang towards him and dealt him a blow with the axe hurling his head to the top rafter of the red branch till the whole hall shook cuchulainn again caught up the head and gave it a blow with the axe and smashed it thereafter the bachlach rose up   on the morrow the ultonians were watching cuchulainn to see whether he would shirk the bachlach as the other heroes had done as cuchulainn was awaiting the bachlach they saw that great dejection seized him it had been fitting had they sung his dirge they felt sure his life would last only till the bachlach came then quoth cuchulainn with  cuil fly conveys a pun upon cuchulainns name incapable of being reproduced  the feast of bricriu shame to conchobar: thou shall not go until my pledge to the bachlach is fulfilled for death awaits me and i would rather have death with honour   they were there as the day was closing when they saw the bachlach approaching where is cuchulainn he quoth here am i he answered youre dull of speech tonight unhappy one greatly you fear to die yet though great your fear death you have not shirked thereafter cuchulainn went up to him and stretched his neck across the block which was of such size that his neck reached but halfway stretch out your neck you wretch the bachlach quoth you keep me in torment quoth cuchulainn despatch me quickly last night by my troth i tormented you not verily i swear if you torment me i shall make myself as long as a crane above you i cannot slay you quoth the bachlach what with the size of the block and the shortness of your neck and of your side sic   then cuchulainn stretched out his neck so that a warriors fullgrown foot would have fitted between any two of his ribs his neck he distended till it reached the other side of the block the bachlach raised his axe till it reached the rooftree of the hall the creaking of the old hide that was about the fellow and the crashing of the axeboth his arms being raised aloft with all his mightwere as the loud noise of a wood tempesttossed in a night of storm down it came then  on his neck its blunt side belowall the nobles of ultonia gazing upon them   o cuchulainn arise  of the warriors of ultonia and erin no matter their mettle none is found to be compared with thee in valour bravery and truthfulness the sovranty of the heroes of erin to thee from this hour forth and the champions portion undisputed and to thy lady the precedence alway of the ladies of ultonia in the mead hall and whosoever shall lay wager against thee from now as my folks swear i swear while on life he will be in sore scathe then the bachlach vanished it was curoi mac dairi who in that guise had come to fulfil the promise he had given to cuchulainn and thus henceforth the champions portion of emain and the ulster womens war of words and the champions wager in emain and the hosting of the ultonians to cruachan
