bricrius feast and the war of words of the women of ulster  bricriu of the bitter tongue made a great feast one time for conchubar son of ness and for all the chief men of ulster he was the length of a year getting the feast ready and he built a great house to hold it in at dunrudraige he built it in the likeness of the house of the red branch in emain but it was entirely beyond all the buildings of that time in shape and in substance in plan and in ornament in pillars and in facings in doors and in carvings so that it was spoken of in all parts it was on the plan of the drinkinghall at emain it was made inside and it having nine divisions from hearth to wall and every division faced with bronze that was overlaid with gold thirty feet high in the front part of the hail there was a royal seat made for conchubar high above all the other seats of the house it was set with carbuncles and other precious stones of all colours that shone like gold and silver so that they made the night the same as the day and round about it were the twelve seats of the twelve heroes of ulster  good as the material was the work done on it was as good it took six horses to bring home every beam and the strength of six men to fix every pole and thirty of the best skilled men in ireland were ordering it and directing it    then bricriu made a sunny parlour for himself on a level with conchubars seat and the seats of the heroes of valour and it had every sort of ornament and windows of glass were put on every side of it the way he could see the hall from his seat for he knew the men of ulster would not let him stop inside  when he had finished building the hall and the sunny parlour and had furnished them with quilts and coverings beds and pillows and with a full supply of meat and drink so that nothing was wanting he set out for emain macha to see conchubar and the chief men of ulster  it happened that day they were all gathered together at emain macha and they made him welcome and they put him to sit beside conchubar and he said to conchubar and to them all come with me to a feast i have made ready i am willing to go said conchubar if the men of ulster are willing  but fergus son of rogh and the others said: we will not go for if we do our dead will be more than our living after bricriu has set us to quarrel with one another it will be worse for you if you do not come said bricriu what will you do if they do not go with you said conchubar i will stir up strife said bricriu between the kings and the leaders and the heroes of valour and the swordsmen till every one makes an end of the other if they will not come with me to use my feast we will not go for the sake of pleasing you said conchubar i will stir up anger between father and son so that they will be the death of one another said bricriu if i fail in doing that i will make a quarrel between mother and daughter if that fails i will put the two breasts of every woman of ulster striking one against the other and destroying one another it is better for us to go said fergus let us consult with the chief men of ulster said sencha son of ailell some harm    will come of it said conchubar if we do not consult together against this man  on that all the chief men met together in council and it is what sencha advised: it is best for you to get securities from bricriu as you have to go along with him and put eight swordsmen around him to make him leave the house as soon as he has laid out the feast for you so ferbenn ferbeson son of conchubar brought the answer to bricriu i am satisfied to do that said bricriu with that the men of ulster set out from emain host troop and company under king chief and leader and it was a good march they all made together to dunrudraige  then bricriu set himself to think how with the securities that were given for him he could best manage to set the men of ulster one against the other after he had been thinking a while he went over to laegaire buadach son of connad son of iliath all good be with you laegaire winner of battles you mighty mallet of bregia you hot hammer of meath you flamered thunderbolt what hinders you from getting the championship of ireland for ever if i want it i can get it said laegaire you will be head of all the champions of ireland said bricriu if you do as i advise i will do that indeed said laegaire  well said bricriu if you can get the champions portion at the feast in my house the championship of ireland will be yours for ever and the champions portion of my house is worth fighting for he said for it is not the portion of a fools house there goes with it a vat of good wine with room enough in it to hold three of the brave men of ulster with that a sevenyearold boar that has been fed since it was born on no other thing but fresh milk and fine meal in springtime curds and sweet milk in summer the kernel of nuts and wheat    in harvest beef and broth in the winter with that a sevenyearold bullock that never had in its mouth since it was a sucking calf either heather or twig tops but only sweet milk and herbs meadow hay and corn along with that fivescore wheaten cakes made with honey that is the champions portion of my house and since you are yourself the best hero among the men of ulster he said it is but right to give it to you and that is my wish you to get it and at the end of the day when the feast is spread out let your chariotdriver rise up and it is to him the champions portion will be given there will be dead men if that is not done said laegaire then bricriu laughed for he liked to hear that  when he had done stirring up laegaire buadach he went on till he met with conall cearnach may good be with you conall he said it is you are the hero of fights and of battles it is many victories you have won up to this over the heroes of ulster by the time the men of ulster cross the boundary of a strange country it is three days and three nights in advance of them you are over many a ford and river it is you who protect their rear coming back again so that no enemy can get past you or through you or over you what would hinder you from being given the champions portion of emain to hold for ever great as was his treachery with laegaire he showed twice as much in what he said to conall cearnach  when he had satisfied himself that conall was stirred up to a quarrel he went on to cuchulain may all good be with you cuchulain conqueror of bregia bright banner of the life darling of emain beloved by wives and by maidens cuchulain is no nickname for you today for you are the champion of the men of ulster it is you keep off their great quarrels and disputes it is you get justice for every man of them it is you have what all the men of ulster are wanting in all the men    of ulster acknowledge that your bravery your valour and your deeds are beyond their own why then would you leave the champions portion for some other one of the men of ulster when not one of them would be able to keep it from you  by the god of my people said cuchulain whoever comes to try and keep it from me will lose his head with that bricriu left them and followed after the army as if he had done nothing to stir up a quarrel at all  after that they came to the feastinghouses and went in and every one took his place king prince landowner swordsman and young fighting man one half of the house was set apart for conchubar and his following and the other half was kept for the wives of the heroes of ulster  and there were attending on conchubar in the front part of the house fergus son of rogh celthair son of uthecar eoghan son of durthact the two sons of the king fiacha and fiachaig fergus son of leti cuscraid the stutterer of macha sencha son of ailell the three sons of fiachach that is rus and dare and imchad muinremar son of geirgind errge echbel amergin son of ecit mend son of salchah dubthach doel uladh the beetle of ulster feradach find fectnach fedelmid son of ilair cheting furbaide ferbend rochad son of fathemon laegaire buadach conall cearnach cuchulain conrad son of mornai erc son of fedelmid iollan son of fergus fintan son of nial cethern son of fintan factna son of sencad conla the false ailell the honeytongued the chief men of ulster with the young men and the songmakers  while the feast was being spread out the musicians and players made music for them as soon as bricriu had spread the feast with its welltasting savoury meats he was ordered by his sureties to leave the hall on the    moment and they rose up with their drawn swords in their hands to put him out so he and his followers went out and when he was on the threshold of the house he turned and called out: the champions portion of my house is not the portion of a fools house let it be given to whoever you think the best hero of ulster and with that he left them  then the distributers rose up to divide the food and the chariotdriver of laegaire buadach sedlang son of riangabra rose up and said to them let you give the champions portion to laegaire for he has the best right to it of all the young heroes of ulster  then id son of riangabra chariotdriver to conan cearnach rose up and bade them to give it to his master but laeg son of riangabra said it is to cuchulain it must be brought and it is no disgrace for all the men of ulster to give it to him for it is he is the bravest of you all that is not true said conall and laegaire said the same  with that they got up upon the floor and put on their shields and took hold of their swords and they attacked and struck at one another till the one half of the hall was as if on fire with the clashing of swords and spears and the other half was white as chalk with the whiteness of the shields there was fear on the whole gathering all the men were put from their places and there was great anger on conchubar himself and on fergus son of rogh to see the injustice and the hardship of two men fighting against one conall and laegaire both together attacking cuchulain but there was no one among the men of ulster dared part them till sencha spoke to conchubar it is time for you to part these men he said  with that conchubar and fergus came between them and the fighters let their hands drop to their sides will you do as i advise said sencha    paragraph continues we will do it they said then my advice is said sencha for this night to divide the champions portion among the whole gathering and after that to let it be settled according to the judgment of ailell king of connaught for it will be better for the men of ulster this business to be settled in cruachan  so with that they sat down to the feast again and gathered round the fire and drank and made merry  all this time bricriu and his wife were in their upper room and from there he had seen how things were going on in the great hall and he began to search his mind how he could best stir up the women to quarrel with one another as he had stirred up the men when he had done searching his mind it just chanced as he could have wished that fedelm of the fresh heart came from the hall with fifty women after her laughing and merry bricriu went to meet her all good be with you tonight wife of laegaire buadach fedelm of the fresh heart is no nickname for you with respect to your appearance and your wisdom and your family conchubar king of ulster is of your kindred laegaire buadach is your husband i would not think well of it that any of the women of ulster should go before you into the hail for it is at your heel that all the other women of ulster should walk if you go first into the hall tonight you will be queen over them all for ever and ever  fedelm went on after that the length of three ridges from the hall  after that there came out lendabair the favourite daughter of eoghan son of durthact wife of conall cearnach  bricriu came over to her and he said good be with you lendabair and that is no nickname for you are the favourite and the darling of the men of the    whole world because of the brightness of your beauty as far as your husband is beyond the whole world in bravery and in comeliness so far are you before the women of ulster great as his deceit was in what he said to fedelm it was twice as great in what he said to lendabair  then emer came out and fifty women after her health be with you emer daughter of forgall manach wife of the best man in ireland emer of the beautiful hair is no nickname for you the kings and princes of ireland are quarrelling with one another about you so far as the sun outshines the stars of heaven so far do you outshine the women of the whole world in form and shape and birth in youth and beauty and nicety in good name and wisdom and speech however great his deceit was towards the other women it was twice as much towards emer  the three women went on then till they met at one spot three ridges from the house but none of them knew that bricriu had been speaking to the other they set out then to go back to the house their walk was even and quiet and easy on the first ridge hardly did one of them put her foot before the other but on the next ridge their steps were closer and quicker and when they came to the ridge next the house it was hardly one of them could keep up with the other so that they took up their skirts nearly to their knees each one trying to get first into the hall because of what bricriu had said to them that whoever would be first to enter the house would be queen of the whole province and such was the noise they made in their race that it was like the noise of forty chariots coming the whole palace shook and all the men started up for their arms striking against one another  stop said sencha it is not enemies that are coming it is bricriu has set the women quarrelling    paragraph continues by the god of my people he said unless the hall is shut against them those that are dead among us will be more than those that are living with that the doorkeepers shut the doors but emer was quicker than the other women and outran them and put her back against the door and called to the doorkeepers before the other women came up so that the men rose up each of them to open the door before his own wife so that she might be the first to come within  it is a bad night this will be said conchubar and he struck the silver rod he had in his hand against the bronze post of the hall and they all sat down quiet yourselves said sencha it is not a war of arms we are going to have here it is a war of words each woman then put herself under the protection of her husband outside and then there followed the war of words of the women of ulster  fedelm of the fresh heart was the first to speak and it is what she said:  the mother who bore me was free noble equal to my father in rank and in race the blood that is in me is royal i was brought up like one of royal blood i am counted beautiful in form and in shape and in appearance i was brought up to good behaviour to courage to mannerly ways look at laegaire my husband and what his red hand does for ulster it was by himself alone its boundaries were kept from the enemies that were as strong as all ulster put together he is a defence and a protection against wounds he is beyond all the heroes his victories are greater than their victories why should not i fedelm the beautiful the lovely the joyful be the first to step into the drinkinghall tonight  then lendabair spoke and it is what she said:  i myself have beauty too and good sense and good    carriage it is i should walk into the hall with free even steps before all the women of ulster  for my husband is pleasant conall of the great shield the victorious he is proud going with brave steps up to the spears of the fight he is proud coming back to me after it with the heads of his enemies in his hands  he brings his hard sword into the battle for ulster he defends every ford or he destroys it to keep out the enemy he is a hero will have a stone raised over him  the son of noble amergin who can speak against his courage or his deeds it is conall who leads the heroes  all eyes look on the glory of lendabair why would she not go first into the hall of the king  then emer spoke and it is what she said:  there is no woman comes up to me in appearance in shape in wisdom there is no one comes up to me for goodness of form or brightness of eye or good sense or kindness or good behaviour  no one has the joy of loving or the strength of loving that i have all ulster desires me surely i am a nut of the heart if i were a light woman there would not be a husband left to any of you tomorrow  and my husband is cuchulain it is he is not a hound that is weak there is blood on his spear there is blood on his sword his white body is black with blood his soft skin is furrowed with sword cuts there are many wounds on his thigh  but the flame of his eyes is turned westward he is the strong protector his chariot is red its cushions are red he fights from over the ears of horses from over the breath of men he leaps in the air like a salmon when he makes his hero leap he does strange feats the dark feat the blind feat the feat of nine he breaks    down armies in the hard fight he saves the life of proud armies he finds joy in the terror of the ignorant  your fine heroes of ulster are not worth a stalk of grass compared with my husband cuchulain letting on to have a womans sickness on them he is like the clear red blood they are like the scum and the leavings worth no more than a stalk of grass  your fine women of ulster they are shaped like cows and led like cows when they are put beside the wife of cuchulain  when the men in the hail heard what the women said laegaire and conall made a rush at the wall and broke a plank out of it at their own height to let their own wives in but cuchulain raised up that part of the house that was opposite to his place so that the stars and the sky could be seen through the wan by that opening emer came in with the fifty women that waited on her and with them the women that waited on the other two none of the other women could be compared at all with emer and no one at all could be compared with her husband and then cuchulain let the wall he had lifted fall suddenly again so that seven feet of it went into the ground and the whole house shook and bricrius upper room was laid flat in such a way that bricriu himself and his wife were thrown into the dirt among the dogs my grief cried bricriu enemies are come in and he got up quickly and took a turn round and he saw that the hall was now crooked and leaning entirely to one side he clapped his hands together and went inside but he was so covered with dirt that none of the ulster people could know him it was only by his way of speaking they made out who he was  then he said from the middle of the floor it is a pity i ever made a feast for you men of ulster    paragraph continues my house is more to me than everything else i have i put geasa that is bonds on you not to drink or eat or to sleep till you leave my house the same way as you found it at that all the men of ulster went out and tried to pull the house straight but they did not raise it by so much as a hands breadth  what are we to do they said there is nothing for you to do said sencha but to ask the man that pulled it crooked to set it straight again  upon that they bid cuchulain to put the wall up straight again and bricriu said o king of the heroes of ireland unless you can set it up straight there is no man in the world can do it and all the men of ulster begged and prayed of cuchulain to settle the matter and that they might not have to go without food or drink cuchulain rose up and tried to lift the house with a tug and he failed anger came on him then and the hero light shone about him and he put out all his strength and strained himself till a mans foot could find place between each of his ribs and he lifted the house up till it was as straight as it was before after that they enjoyed the feast with the chief men on the one side round about conchubar high king of ulster and their wives on the other sidefedelm of the nine shapes nine shapes she could take on and each shape more beautiful than the other and findchaem daughter of cathbad wife of amergin of the iron jaw and devorgill wife of lugaid of the red stripes besides emer and fedelm of the fresh heart and lendabair and it would be too long to count and to tell of all the other noble women besides  there was soon a buzzing of words in the hail again with the women praising their men as if to stir up another quarrel between them then sencha son of    ailell got up and shook his bell branch and they all stopped to listen to him and then to quiet the women he said:  have done with this wordfighting lest you drive the men of ulster to grow whitefaced in the anger and the pride of battle with one another  it is through the fault of women the shields of men are broken heroes go out to fight and struggle with one another in their anger  it is the folly of women brings men to do these things to bruise what they cannot bind up again to strike down what they cannot raise up again wives of heroes keep yourself from this  but emer answered him and it is what she said:  it is right for me to speak sencha and i the wife of the comely pleasant hero who is beyond all others in beauty in wisdom in speaking since the learning that was easy to him is done with  no one can do his feats the overbreath feat the apple feat the ghost feat the screw feat the cat feat the redwhirling feat the barbedspear feat the quick stroke the fire of the mouth the hems cry the wheel feat the swordedge feat no one can throw himself against hardspiked places the way he does  there is no one is his equal in youth in form in brightness in birth in mind in voice in bravery in boldness in fire in skill no one in his equal in hunting in running in strength in victories in greatness there is no man to be found who can be put beside cuchulain  if it is truth you are speaking emer said conan cearnach let this lad of feats stand up that we may see them  i will not said cuchulain i am tired and broken today i will do no more till after i have had food and sleep it was true what he said for it was on    that morning he had met with the grey of macha by the side of the grey lake at slieve fuad when it came out of the lake cuchulain slipped his hands round the neck of the horse and the two of them struggled and wrestled with one another and in that way they went all round ireland till late in the day he brought the horse home to emain it was in the same way he got the black sainglain from the black lake of sainglen  and cuchulain said: today myself and the grey of macha have gone through the great plains of ireland bregia of meath the seashore marsh of muirthemne macha through moy medba currech cleitech cerna lia of linn locharn fer femen fergna curros domnand ros roigne and eo and now i would sooner eat and sleep than do any other thing but i swear by the gods my people swear by he said i would be ready to fight with any man of you if i had but my fill of food and of sleep well said bricriu this has gone on long enough let food and drink be brought and let the womens war be put a stop to till the feast is done  they did so and it was a pleasant time they had till the end of three days and three nights         cuchulain of muirthemne by lady augusta gregory  at sacredtextscom       v     the championship of ulster  after they were gone back to emain after bricrius feast a quarrel began between conall and laegaire and cuchulain about the champions portion and conchubar and the chief men of ulster came between them to settle it and conchubar bade them to go to cruachan in connaught to have the matter judged by ailell and by maeve and if that fails you he said what you have to do is to go to curoi son of daire at slieve mis in munster and it is a true judgment he will give for he is just and fairminded his house is open to guests his hand is good in battle in leading he is a king he will give you a right judgment but it is only a brave man will ask it from him for be is wise in all sorts of enchantments and can do things that no other man can do  we will go first to cruachan said cuchulain i agree to that said laegaire let us go then said conall cearnach let horses be brought and your chariot yoked conall said cuchulain and go on the first i would not like that said conall that is no wonder said cuchulain for every one knows the awkwardness of your horses and the unsteadiness of your chariot it is so heavy that each of the wheels raises the sod on each side wherever it goes the way    that for the length of a year it is easy for the men of ulster to know the track it has left after it  do you hear that laegaire said conall it is for you to go first do not begin to mock at me said laegaire for i am good at crossing fords and i am ready to go up and face a storm of spears before any man but do not put me beside chariot kings till i practise going through hard and narrow places and racing against single chariots till the champion of a single chariot will be afraid to pass me  with that laegaire had his chariot yoked and leaped into it he drove over magh da gabal the plain of the two forks over bernaid na foraire the gap of the watch over the ford of carpat fergus over the ford of the morrigu to caerthund cluana da dam the rowan meadow of the two oxen in the fews of firbuide by the four ways past dundealgan across magh slicech the peeled plain westward by bregia and it was not long till conall cearnach followed after him and many of the chief men of ulster with them  but cuchulain stayed behind the others amusing the women of ulster with his feats he did nine feats with apples nine with spears and nine with knives without ever letting one touch the other and he took three times fifty needles from the women and threw them up one after the other so that each needle went into the eye of the other and in that way they were all joined together then he gave every woman her needle back into her own hand  but laeg son of riangabra went to look for him and reproached him and said: you pitiful squinter your courage has gone from you the champions portion is lost to you the men of ulster have got to cruachan before this i never thought of it my laeg said cuchulain but yoke the chariot for me now so laeg yoked it and they set out on their journey by    that time the men of ulster were come to magh breagh the fine meadow but cuchulain after he was roused up by laeg travelled so fast and the grey of macha and the black sainglain went racing in such a way with his chariot across the whole province of conchubar across slieve fuad and the plain of bregia that he came up with the others before they came to cruachan  the noise the whole troop made was so great going at such speed as they did that a great shaking came on cruachan and the arms fell from the racks to the ground and the whole of the dun began to shake so that every man was trembling like a rush in a stream on that maeve said: since the day i first came to cruachan i never before heard thunder there being no clouds in the sky then findabair of the fair eyebrows daughter of ailell and of maeve went up for she had a birds sight to her sunny parlour over the great door of the fort to tell them what was coming  dear mother she said i see a chariot coming over the plain tell me what is its appearance said maeve and the colour of its horses and the appearance of the man that sits in it i see well said findabair the two horses that are in the chariot two fiery dappled greys of the one colour shape and goodness having the one speed keeping the one pace their ears pricked their heads high their nostrils broad foreheads broad manes and tails curled thinsided widechested galloping together the chariot is made of fine wood with wickerwork newly polished the yoke curved with silver ornaments on it it has two black wheels soft looped yellow reins i see in the chariot a big stout man with reddish yellow hair with long forked beard he has a soft purple coat about him and it striped with bright gold his bronze shield is edged with gold there is a fivepronged javelin at his wrist a cover of strange birds feathers over his head    i know well who that man is said maeve and it is what she said: a companion of kings an old bestower of victories a storm of war a flame of judgment a long knife of victory that will cut us to pieces mighty laegaire of the red hand his sword cuts through men as a knife cuts through a leek his stroke is the back stroke of the wave to the land and i swear by the gods my people swear by she said if it is in anger and for fighting laegaire buadach is coming at us that as leeks are cut close to the ground with a sharp knife the same way we will be cut down as many of us as are in cruachan unless we smooth down his anger by giving in to everything he asks  good mother said findabair i see another chariot as good as the first coming over the plain tell me what is its appearance said maeve  i see she said yoked to the chariot on the one side a red horse taking strong high strides across fords and splashes over banks and gaps over plains and hollows with the quickness of birds that the quick eye loses in following on the other side a bay horse of great strength it is at full speed he races over the plain between stones and hard places he finds no hindrance in the land of oaks hurrying on his way a chariot of fine wood with wickerwork on two wheels of bright bronze its pole bright with silver its frame very high and creaking having a curved firm yoke with looped yellow reins  in the chariot a fair man with wavy hanging hair his face white and red his vest clean and white his cloak blue and crimson his shield brown with yellow bosses its edge worked with bronze in his hand a bright spear a cover of the feathers of strange birds over the wicker frame of his chariot  i know who that man is said maeve and she said then: the growling of a lion a flame that can cut    like a sharpened stone he heaps head on head battle on battle as a trout is cut upon red sandstone so would the son of finchoem cut us if he came on us in anger  for by the oath of my people she said as a speckled fish is beaten upon a shining red stone with iron rods so would we be broken by conall cearnach if he came against us  i see another chariot coming over the plain said findabair tell me what its appearance is said maeve i see two horses of the one size and beauty the one fierceness and speed with ears pricked heads high spirited and powerful with fine nostrils wide foreheads mane and tail curled leaping together the one grey handsome with broad thighs eager leaping thundering and trampling as he goes his fierce hoofs throw up sods of earth like a flock of swift birds after him as he gallops on his way he breathes out a blast of hot breath a fire comes from his curbed jaws the other dark smallheaded wellshaped broadhoofed thinsided highcouraged broadbacked surefooted spirited he takes long strides in the race he leaps over streams he throws off heaviness he crosses the plains of the middle valley they come together with fast joyful steps moving over the plain like a swift mountain mist or like the speed of a hill hind or like a hare on level ground or like the rushing of a loud wind in winter  the chariot is of fine wood with wickerwork having two iron wheels a bright silver pole with bronze ornaments a frame very high and creaking strengthened with iron a curved yoke overlaid with gold two soft looped yellow reins  i see in the chariot a dark sad man comeliest of the men of ireland a pleated crimson tunic about him fastened at the breast with a brooch of inlaid gold a longsleeved linen cloak on him with a white hood    embroidered with flamered gold his eyebrows as black as the blackness of a spit seven lights in his eyes seven colours about his bead love and fire in his look across his knees there lies a goldhilted sword there is a bloodred spear ready to his hand a sharptempered blade with a shaft of wood over his shoulders a crimson shield with a rim of silver overlaid with shapes of beasts in gold  there is before him in the chariot a driver a very thin tall freckled man very bright red hair kept back from his face with a golden thread a cup of gold at each side of his head a short cloak about him with sleeves opening at the two elbows in his hand a goad of red gold to guide his horses  that is truly a drop before a downpour said maeve i know well who that man is and it is what she said: like the sound of an angry sea like a great moving wave with the madness of a wild beast that is vexed he leaps through his enemies in the crash of battle they hear their death in his shout he heaps deed upon deed head upon head his is a name to be put in songs as fresh malt is ground in the mill so shall we be ground by cuchulain  for i swear by the oath of my people she said that as a mill of ten spokes grinds very hard malt so he with only himself would grind us to dust and to gravel if we had the whole province with us unless his anger and his heat go down  and what way are the rest of the men of ulster coming she said and findabair answered her and it is what she said: hand to hand arm to arm side to side shoulder to shoulder wheel to wheel axle to axle that is the way they are coming their horses are coming on us like thunder on the roof like heavy waves stirred by the storm the trampling of their feet makes the earth shake under them    and maeve said let our women be ready before them with vats of cold water let the beds be made ready bring the best of food the best of ale open the courtyard have a welcome before them and surely they will not harm us  then maeve went out by the high door of the dun into the courtyard and three limes fifty young girls attending her with three vats of cold water to cool the beat of the three heroes in front of the rest and she gave them their choice would each man have a house for himself or would they have one house for the three a house for each to himself said cuchulain and when the rest of the men of ulster came ailell and maeve with their whole household went out and bade them welcome we are well pleased with the welcome said sencha for them  after that they all came into the fort and into the palace they went round from one door to the other and there was room for them all and the musicians were playing music while everything was being made ready and conchubar and fergus son of rogh were in ailells division with nine others along with them and there was a great feast made ready then and they stopped there the length of three days and three nights  at the end of that time ailell asked conchubar what was the business that had brought them there and sencha told him the whole story about the quarrel of the women as to who should walk first and the quarrel of their husbands for the champions portion and they were not satisfied to be judged by anyone but yourself he said ailell did not seem to be well pleased at that indeed it was no friend of mine that left this judgment on me he said there is no better judge than yourself said sencha well said ailell you must give me time to think upon it do not make too much delay said sencha for we cannot spare    our heroes long from us three days and three nights will be enough for me said ailell that much will not break friendship said sencha  with that the men of ulster went home to emain leaving laegaire and conall and cuchulain to be judged by ailell and they left their blessing with ailell and with maeve and their curse with bricriu because it was he had first started the quarrel     that night the three heroes were given as good a feast as before but they were put to eat it in a room by themselves when night came on three enchanted monsters with the shape of cats were let out from the cave that was in the hill of the sidhe at cruachan to attack them when conall and laegaire saw them they got up into the rafters leaving their food after them and there they stayed till morning cuchulain did not leave his place but when one of the monsters came to attack him he gave a blow of his sword at its head but the sword slipped off as if from a stone then the monster stayed quiet and cuchulain sat there through the night watching it with the break of day the cats were gone and ailell came in and saw what way the three heroes were are you not satisfied to give the championship to cuchulain after this he said we are not said conall and laegaire it is not against beasts we are used to fight but against men  then maeve said to them go and spend the night with my fosterfather ercol and his wife garmna so they went but first they were given their choice of food for their horses conall and laegaire chose oats two years old for theirs but cuchulain chose barley grain for his then they set out racing all the way and cuchulain winning the race  ercol and garmna bade them welcome and they knew it was to try them they had been sent there so    they sent them out that night one after the other to fight with the witches of the valley  laegaire went first but he could not stand against them and he came back and left his arms and his clothes with them  then conall went and he was driven back and left his spear with them but he brought his sword that was his best weapon away with him  then cuchulain went down into the valley and the witches screamed at him and attacked him and he and they fought together till his spear was in splinters his shield broken and his clothes torn off him the witches were beating him and getting the better of him but laeg saw it and he called out o cuchulain he said you poor coward you squinting clown your courage is gone from you witches to be beating you then great anger came on cuchulain and he turned on the witches and cut and gashed them till the valley was filled with their blood and he brought away their cloaks of battle with him and went back to the house where his comrades were and garmna and her daughter buan made much of him and bade him welcome  they slept there that night and the next day ercol challenged them to come one by one each man with his horse to fight against himself and his horse laegaire was the first to go against him and his horse was killed by ercols horse and he himself was overcome by ercol so that he took to flight and did not stop till he got back to cruachan and he brought the story there that both his companions had been killed by ercol conall was the next to run away after his horse being killed by ercols horse and his servant rathand was drowned in the river as he ran and it takes its name after him snam rathand from that day  but the grey of macha killed ercols horse and cuchulain put down ercol and tied him behind his    chariot and set out for cruachan and buan garmnas daughter ran out after the chariot for love of cuchulain to follow him and she knew the track of his chariot for it was no roundabout track it used to take but to be breaking through gaps or going over them and in following it at last she gave a great leap and fell and her forehead struck against a rock and she died and it is from this the place was given the name of buans grave  and when conall and cuchulain got back to cruachan they found the people of the dun keening them for by the report laegaire brought they were sure they had been killed  then ailell went to his inner room and leaned his back against the wall for he was not quiet in his mind and he knew there was danger in whatever judgment he might give and he had not eaten or slept for three days and three nights then maeve said to him it is a coward you are and if you do not settle this matter i will settle it myself it is hard for me to give judgment said ailell it is a misfortune for any one to have to do it it is easy enough said maeve for laegaire and conall cearnach are as different as bronze and silver and conall cearnach and cuchulain are as different as silver and red gold  after a while when maeve had searched her mind laegaire buadach was called to her welcome laegaire buadach she said it is right for you to have the champions portion we give you the headship of the heroes of ireland from this out and the champions portion and along with that this cup of bronze having a bird in raised silver on the bottom take it with you as a token of the judgement but let no one see it till you come to conchubar and his red branch at the end of the day when the champions portion is set out then bring out your cup in the presence of all the great men    of ulster and not one of them will dispute it with you any more for they will know by this token that the championship has been given to you with that the cup was given to him with its full of rich wine and he drank it off at a draught now you have the championship said maeve and i wish you may enjoy it a hundred years at the head of all ulster  so laegaire left her and conall cearnach was called up to the queen welcome conall cearnach she said it is right for us to give you the champions portion and a silver cup along with it having a bird on the bottom in raised gold and she said the same to him as she had said to laegaire before  then conall went away and a messenger was sent to bring cuchulain come up to speak with the king and queen said the messenger  cuchulain was playing chess at the time with laeg his chariotdriver i am not a fool to be mocked at he said and he hurled one of the chessmen at the messenger and hit him between the eyes so that it is hardly he could get back to ailell and maeve  by my word said maeve this cuchulain is hard to deal with and then she came down herself to cuchulain and put her two arms round his neck give your flattery to some other one said cuchulain  but maeve said great son of ulster flame of the heroes of ireland there is no flattery in our mind when it is you we have to do with for if all the heroes of ireland should come here it is to you we would give the champions portion for as to bravery and a great name and as to youth and great deeds it is wellknown that you are far beyond all the men of ireland  cuchulain rose up then and went with maeve into the palace and ailell gave him a great welcome and he was given a gold cup full of wine and it having on the bottom of it a bird in precious stones now you    have the championship said maeve and it is my wish you may enjoy it a hundred years at the head of all the heroes of ulster and besides that ailell and maeve said it is our judgment that as much as you are beyond the heroes of ulster so far is your wife beyond their wives and we think it right that she should walk before the women of ulster when they go together into the drinkinghall  then cuchulain drank at one draught the full of the cup and bade farewell to the king and the queen and the whole household and he went till he came to emain macha at the end of the day and there was no one among the men of ulster would venture to ask news of any of the three until the time came to eat and to drink in the great hall  when the feast was laid out they all stopped their arguing and their talking and gave themselves up to eating and to enjoyment it was sualtim son of roig father of cuchulain was attending the feast that night and conchubars great vat had been filled for it the distributors began serving out the meat but at first they kept back the champions portion then dubthach of the chafer tongue said why is not the champions portion given to one of these three heroes that are come back from cruachan they must surely have brought some token with them that we may know which one is to have it  upon that laegaire buadach rose up and held out the bronze cup with the silver bird on it the champions portion is mine he said and no one can dispute it with me  that is not so said conall cearnach here is my token yours is a bronze cup but mine is a silver cup you see by the difference in them it is to me the champions portion belongs  it belongs to neither of you said cuchulain and    he rose up and he said it was only to deceive you and to keep up the quarrel between us the king and queen we went to gave you those it is to me the champions portion belongs for you see my token that it is far above the others  with that he lifted high up the cup of red gold with the bird on it of precious stones and all the men in the feastinghall saw it it is i myself that will get the championship he said if i get fair play it is yours indeed said conchubar and fergus and all the chief men it is yours by the judgment of ailell and maeve i swear by the oath of my people said laegaire that the cup you have with you was not given to you but bought you gave riches and treasures for it to ailell and maeve the way the championship would not go to any other person but by my hand of valour he said that judgment shall not stand  then with their swords drawn they sprang at one another but conchubar went between them and then they let down their hands and sheathed their swords it is best said sencha for you to go to curoi for judgement we agree to that said they  so on the morning of the morrow the threecuchulain conall and laegaireset out for curois dun at the gate of the dun they unyoked their chariots and they went into the courtyard and blanad daughter of mind curois wife gave them a good welcome curoi was not at home that night but knowing by his enchantments they would come he had left instructions with his wife how to entertain them and she did according to his wish giving them water for washing and drinks for refreshing and beds of the best so that they were well satisfied  when bedtime came blanad told them they were each to take a night to watch the fort till curoi would    come back and it is what he said that you should take your turn according to age  now in whatever part of the world curoi was he made a spell every night over the dun so that it went round like a mill and no entrance could be found in it after the setting of the sun  the first night laegaire buadach took the watch for be was the oldest of the three as he was keeping watch towards the end of the night he saw a great shadow coming towards him from the sea westward very huge and ugly and terrible he thought it and it took the shape of a giant and reached up to the sky and the shining of the sea could be seen between its legs it is how it came its hands full of what had the appearance of stripped oaks and each of them enough for a load of six horses and he hurled one of them at laegaire but it went past him he did this two or three times but the beam did not reach either the skin or the shield of laegaire then laegaire hurled a spear at him and it did not hit him  he stretched out his hand then to laegaire and the length of it reached the three ridges that were between them while they were throwing at one another and he gripped hold of him big and strong as laegaire was he fitted like a child of a year old into his hand  the giant turned him round between his two palms as a chessman is turned in a groove and then he threw him half dead over the wall of the fort into a heap of mud there was no opening there and the people inside the dun thought he had leaped over from outside as a challenge to the others to do the same  there they stayed until the end of the day and at the fall of night conall went out to take the watch as he was older than cuchulain everything happened as it did to laegaire the first night and when the third night came cuchulain went into the seat of the watch    when midnight was come he heard a noise and by the light of the cold moon he saw nine grey shapes coming towards him over the marsh stop said cuchulain who is there if they are friends let them not stir if they are enemies let them come on then they raised a great shout at him and cuchulain rushed at them and attacked them so that the nine fell dead to the ground and he cut their heads off and made a heap of them and sat down again to keep the watch another nine and then another shouted at him but he made an end of the three nines and made one heap of their heads and their arms  while he was watching on through the night tired and downhearted he heard a sound rising from the lake like the sound of a very heavy sea however tired he was his mind would not let him keep quiet without going to see what was the cause of that great noise he heard then he saw a great worm coming up from the lake and it raised itself into the air over him and made for the dun and opened its mouth and it seemed to him that one of the houses would fit into its gullet  then cuchulain with one leap reached its head and put his arm round its neck and stretched his hand across its gullet and tore the monsters heart out and threw it to the ground then the beast fell down and cuchulain hacked it with his sword and made little bits of it and brought the head along with him to the heap of skulls he was sitting there towards the break of day worn out and discouraged and he saw the great shadow shaped like a giant coming to him westward from the sea this is a bad night he said it will be worse for you yet said cuchulain then he threw one of the beams at cuchulain but it passed by him and he did that two or three times but it did not reach either his shield or his skin then he stretched out his hand to grip cuchulain as he did the others but cuchulain    leaped his salmon leap at the head of the monster with his drawn sword and brought him down life for life cuchulain he said and with that he vanished and was no more seen  then cuchulain wondered to himself how his fellows had made their leap over the fort for the wall was big and broad and high and twice he tried it and failed then anger came on him and he went a good way back and made a run and with the dint of the anger that was on him and the courage of his heart and of his mind he hardly took the dew off the tips of the grass in the run and he made one leap over the wall and lit in the middle at the door of the house then he went in through the door and gave a sigh and blanad wife of curoi said that is not the sigh of a beaten man but a conquerors sigh of triumph for the daughter of the king of the isle of the men of falga knew well all cuchulain had gone through that night  the champions portion must now go to cuchulain she said to the others for you see by this that you are not equal to him we do not agree to that said they for we know it was one of his friends among the sidhe came to put us down and to put us out of the championship we will not give up for that they said  then she gave them a message she had from curoi that the three champions were to go back to emain until he would bring his judgment there himself so they bade her farewell and went back to the red branch     it was a good while after this as the men of ulster were in emain tired after the gathering and the games conchubar and fergus son of rogh with the chief men went from the field of sports outside and sat down in the house of the red branch but cuchulain was not    there that night or conall cearnach but all the rest of the chief heroes were in it  as they were sitting there towards evening and the day wearing to its close they saw a big awkward fellow very ugly coming to them into the hail it seemed to them as if none of the men of ulster could reach to half his height he was frightful to look at next his skin he had an old cows hide and a grey cloak around him and over him be had a great spreading branch the size of a winter shed under which thirty cattle could find shelter ravenous yellow eyes he had and in his right hand an axe weighing fifty cauldrons of melted metal its sharpness such that it would cut through hairs if the wind would blow them against its edge  he went over and leaned against the branched beam that was beside the fire  who are you at all said dubthach of the chafer tongue is there no other place for you in the hall that you come up here is it to be candlestick to the house you want or is it to set the house on fire you want  uath the stranger is my name said he and neither of those things is the thing i want the thing i want is the thing i cannot find and i after going through the world of ireland and the whole world looking for it and that is a man that will keep his word and will hold to his agreement with me  what agreement is that said fergus here is this axe he said and the man into whose hands it is put is to cut off my head today i to cut his head off tomorrow and as you men of ulster have a name beyond the men of all countries for strength and skill for courage for greatness for highmindedness for behaviour for truth and generosity for worthiness let you find one among you that will hold to his word    and keep to his bargain conchubar i put aside because of his kingship and fergus son of rogh for the same reason but outside these two come whichever of you will venture he to cut off my head tonight i to cut off his head tomorrow night  it is not right for dishonour to be put on a whole province said fergus for the want of one man that will keep his word sure there is no champion here after these two are left out said dubthach by my word there will be one this moment said laegaire and he leaped out on the floor of the hail stoop down clown that i may cut off your head tonight you to cut off mine tomorrow night by the oath of my people said dubthach it is no good prospect you have if the man killed tonight comes to kill you tomorrow  then uath put spells on the edge of the axe and laid his neck down on a block and laegaire struck a blow across it with the axe till it went into the block underneath and the head fell on the floor and the house was filled with the blood but presently uath rose up and gathered his head and his axe to his breast and went out from the hall his neck streaming with blood so that there was terror on all the people in the house  i swear said dubthach if this stranger being killed comes back tomorrow night he will not leave a man alive in ulster  back be came the next night to have his agreement kept but laegaires heart failed him and be was nowhere to be found but conall cearnach was in the hall and he said he would make a new agreement with him so all happened the same as the night before but when uath came the next day it was the same with conall as with laegaire his heart failed him when it came to the keeping of his bargain    cuchulain was there that night when uath came in and began to reproach and to mock at them all as for you men of ulster he said all your courage and your daring is gone from you you covet a great name but you are not able to earn it where is that poor squinting fellow that is called cuchulain he said till i see if his word is any better than the word of the others i will keep my word without any agreement said cuchulain that is likely you miserable fly it is in great fear of death you are  on that cuchulain made a leap towards him and gave him a blow with the axe and hurled his head to the top rafter of the hail so that the whole house shook  on the morrow the men of ulster were watching cuchulain to see if he would break his word to the stranger as the others had done as cuchulain sat there waiting for him they saw that he was very downhearted and they made sure his life was at its end and that they might as well begin keening him and then cuchulain said to conchubar and there was hanging of the head on him do not go from this till my agreement is fulfilled for death is coming to me but i would sooner meet with death than break my word  they were there till the close of day and then they saw uath coming where is cuchulain he said here i am be answered it is dull your speech is tonight said the stranger it is in great fear of death you are but however great your fear you have not failed me  then cuchulain went to him and laid his head on the block stretch out your head better said he you are keeping me in torment said cuchulain put an end to me quickly for last night he said by my oath i made no delay with you then he    stretched out his neck and uath raised his axe till it reached the rafters of the hail and the creaking of the old hide that was about him and the crashing of the axe through the rafters was like the loud noise of a wood in a stormy night but when the axe came down it was with its blunt side and it was the floor it struck so that cuchulain was not touched at all and all the chief men of ulster were standing around looking on and they saw on the moment that it was no strange clown was in it but curoi son of daire that had come to try the heroes through his enchantments  rise up cuchulain he said of all the heroes of ulster whatever may be their daring there is not one to compare with you in courage and in bravery and in truth the championship of the heroes of ireland is yours from this out and the champions portion with it and to your wife the first place among all the women of ulster and whoever tries to put himself before you after this he said i swear by the oath my people swear by his own life will be in danger  with that he left them and this was the end of the womens war of words and of the quarrel among the heroes for the championship of ulster
