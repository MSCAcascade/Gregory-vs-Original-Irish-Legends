in the house of feidlimid the son of dall even he who was the narrator of stories to conor the king the men of ulster sat at their ale and before the men in order to attend upon them stood the wife of feidlimid and she was great with child round about the board went drinkinghorns and portions of food and the revellers shouted in their drunken mirth and when the men desired to lay themselves down to sleep the woman also went to her couch and as she passed through the midst of the house the child cried out in her womb so that its shriek was heard throughout the whole house and throughout the outer court that lay about it and upon that shriek all the men sprang up and head closely packed by head they thronged together in the house whereupon sencha the son of ailill rebuked them: let none of you stir cried he and let the woman be brought before us that we may learn what is the meaning of that cry then they brought the woman before them and thus spoke to her feidlimid her spouse:  what is that of all cries far the fiercest in thy womb raging loudly and long through all ears with that clamour thou piercest with that scream from bides swollen and strong: of great woe for that cry is foreboding my heart that is torn through with terror and sore with the smart  then the woman turned her and she approached cathbad the druid for he was a man of knowledge and thus she spoke to him:  give thou ear to me cathbad thou fair one of face thou great crown of our honour and royal in race let the man so exalted still higher be set let the druid draw knowledge that druids can get for i want words of wisdom and none can i fetch nor to felim a torch of sure knowledge can stretch: as no wit of a woman can wot what she bears i know naught of that cry from within me that tears  and then said cathbad:  tis a maid who screamed wildly so lately fair and curling shall locks round her flow and her eyes be bluecentred and stately and her cheeks like the foxglove shall glow for the tint of her skin we commend her in its whiteness like snow newly shed and her teeth are all faultless in splendour and her lips like to coral are red: a fair woman is she for whom heroes that fight in their chariots for ulster to death shall be dight  tis a woman that shriek who hath given goldenhaired with long tresses and tall for whose love many chiefs shall have striven and great kings for her favours shall call to the west she shall hasten beguiling a great host that from ulster shall steal: red as coral her lips shall be smiling as her teeth white as pearls they reveal: aye that woman is fair and great queens shall be fain of her form that is faultless unflawed by a stain  then cathbad laid his hand upon the body of the woman and the little child moved beneath his hand: aye indeed he said it is a woman child who is here: deirdre shall be her name and evil woe shall be upon her  now some days after that came the girl child into the world and then thus sang cathbad:  o deirdre of ruin great cause thou art though famous and fair and pale: ere that flims hid daughter from life shall part all ulster her deeds shall wail  aye mischief shall come in the aftertime thou fair shining maid for thee hear ye this: usnas sons the three chiefs sublime to banishment forced shall be  while thou art in life shall a fierce wild deed in emain though late be done: later yet it shall mourn it refused to heed the guard of rgs powerful son  o lady of worth it is to thee we owe that fergus to exile flies that a son of king conor we hail in woe when fiachna is hurt and dies  o lady of worth it is all thine the guilt gerrc illadans son is slain and when eogan mac doorhas great life is spilt not less shall be found our pain  grim deed shalt thou do and in wrath shalt rave against glorious ulsters king: in that spot shall men dig thee thy tiny grave of deirdre they long shall sing  let that maiden be slain cried out the young men of ulster but not so said conor she shall in the morning be brought to me and shall be reared according to my will and she shall be my wife and in my companionship shall she dwell  the men of ulster were not so hardy as to turn him from his purpose and thus it was done the maiden was reared in a house that belonged to conor and she grew up to be the fairest maid in all ireland she was brought up at a distance from the kings court so that none of the men of ulster might see her till the time came when she was to share the royal couch: none of mankind was permitted to enter the house where she was reared save only her fosterfather and her fostermother and in addition to these levorcham to whom naught could any refuse for she was a witch  now once it chanced upon a certain day in the time of winter that the fosterfather of deirdre had employed himself in skinning a calf upon the snow in order to prepare a roast for her and the blood of the calf lay upon the snow and she saw a black raven who came down to drink it and levorcham said deirdre that man only will i love who hath the three colours that i see here his hair as black as the raven his cheeks red like the blood and his body as white as the snow dignity and good fortune to thee said levorcham that man is not far away yonder is he in the burg which is nigh and the name of him is naisi the son of usnach i shall never be in good health again said deirdre until the time come when i may see him  it befell that naisi was upon a certain day alone upon the rampart of the burg of emain and he sent his warriorcry with music abroad: well did the musical cry ring out that was raised by the sons of usnach each cow and every beast that heard them gave of milk twothirds more than its wont and each man by whom that cry was heard deemed it to be fully joyous and a dear pleasure to him goodly moreover was the play that these men made with their weapons if the whole province of ulster had been assembled together against them in one place and they three only had been able to set their backs against one another the men of ulster would not have borne away victory from those three: so well were they skilled in parry and defence and they were swift of foot when they hunted the game and with them it was the custom to chase the quarry to its death  now when this naisi found himself alone on the plain deirdre also soon escaped outside her house to him and she ran past him and at first he know not who she might be  fair is the young heifer that springs past me he cried  well may the young heifers be great she said in a place where none may find a bull  thou hast as thy bull said he the bull of the whole province of ulster even conor the king of ulster  i would choose between you two she said and i would take for myself a younger bull even such as thou art  not so indeed said naisi for i fear the prophecy of cathbad  sayest thou this as meaning to refuse me said she  yea indeed he said and she sprang upon him and she seized him by his two ears two ears of shame and of mockery shalt thou have she cried if thou take me not with thee release me o my wife said he  that will i  then naisi raised his musical warriorcry and the men of ulster heard it and each of them one after another sprang up: and the sons of usnach hurried out in order to hold back their brother  what is it they said that thou dost let it not be by any fault of thine that war is stirred up between us and the men of ulster  then he told them all that had been done and there shall evil come on thee from this said they moreover thou shalt lie under the reproach of shame so long as thou dost live and we will go with her into another land for there is no king in all ireland who will refuse us welcome if we come to him  then they took counsel together and that same night they departed three times fifty warriors and the same number of women and dogs and servants and deirdre went with them and for a long time they wandered about ireland in homage to this man or that and often conor sought to slay them either by ambuscade or by treachery from round about assaroe near to ballyshannon in the west they journeyed and they turned them back to benn etar in the northeast which men today call the mountain of howth nevertheless the men of ulster drave them from the land and they came to the land of alba and in its wildernesses they dwelled and when the chase of the wild beasts of the mountains failed them they made foray upon the cattle of the men of alba and took them for themselves and the men of alba gathered themselves together with intent to destroy them then they took shelter with the king of alba and the king took them into his following and they served him in war and they made for themselves houses of their own in the meadows by the kings burg: it was on account of deirdre that these houses were made for they feared that men might see her and that on her account they might be slain  now one day the highsteward of the king went out in the early morning and he made a cast about naisis house and saw those two sleeping therein and he hurried back to the king and awaked him: we have said he up to this day found no wife for thee of like dignity to thyself naisi the son of usnach hath a wife of worth sufficient for the emperor of the western world let naisi be slain and let his wife share thy couch  not so said the king but do thou prepare thyself to go each day to her house and woo her for me secretly  thus was it done but deirdre whatsoever the steward told her was accustomed straightway to recount it each even to her spouse and since nothing was obtained from her the sons of usnach were sent into dangers and into wars and into strifes that thereby they might be overcome nevertheless they showed themselves to be stout in every strife so that no advantage did the king gain from them by such attempts as these  the men of alba were gathered together to destroy the sons of usnach and this also was told to deirdre and she told her news to naisi: depart hence said she for if ye depart not this night upon the morrow ye shall he slain and they marched away that night and they betook themselves to an island of the sea  now the news of what had passed was brought to the men of ulster tis pity o conor said they that the sons of usnach should die in the land of foes for the sake of an evil woman it is better that they should come under thy protection and that the fated slaying should be done here and that they should come into their own land rather than that they should fall at the hands of foes let them come to us then said conor and let men go as securities to them the news was brought to them  this is welcome news for us they said we will indeed come and let fergus come as our surety and dubhtach and cormac the son of conor these then went to them and they moved them to pass over the sea  but at the contrivance of conor fergus was pressed to join in an alefeast while the sons of usnach were pledged to eat no food in erin until they had eaten the food of conor so fergus tarried behind with dubhtach and cormac and the sons of usnach went on accompanied by fiacha fergus son until they came to the meadows around emain  now at that time eogan the son of durthacht had come to emain to make his peace with conor for they had for a long time been at enmity and to him and to the warmen of conor the charge was given that they should slay the sons of usnach in order that they should not come before the king the sons of usnach stood upon the level part of the meadows and the women sat upon the ramparts of emain and eogan came with his warriors across the meadow and the son of fergus took his place by naisis side and eogan greeted them with a mighty thrust of his spear and the spear brake naisis back in sunder and passed through it the son of fergus made a spring and he threw both arms around naisi and he brought him beneath himself to shelter him while he threw himself down above him and it was thus that naisi was slain through the body of the son of fergus then there began a murder throughout the meadow so that none escaped who did not fall by the points of the spears or the edge of the sword and deirdre was brought to conor to be in his power and her arms were bound behind her back  now the sureties who had remained behind heard what had been done even fergus and dubhtach and cormac and thereon they hastened forward and they forthwith performed great deeds dubhtach slew with the one thrust of his spear mane a son of conor and fiachna the son of feidelm conors daughter and fergus struck down traigthren the son of traiglethan and his brother and conor was wrath at this and he came to the fight with them so that upon that day three hundred of the men of ulster fell and dubhtach slew the women of ulster and ere the day dawned fergus set emain on fire then they went away into exile and betook them to the land of connaught to find shelter with ailill and maev for they knew that that royal pair would give them good entertainment to the men of ulster the exiles showed no love: three thousand stout men went with them and for sixteen years never did they allow cries of lamentation and of fear among the ulstermen to cease: each night their vengeful forays caused men to quake and to wail  deirdre lived on for a year in the household of conor and during all that time she smiled no smile of laughter she satisfied not herself with food or with sleep and she raised not her head from her knee and if any one brought before her people of mirth she used to speak thus:  though eager troops and fair to see may home return though these ye wait: when usnas sons came home to me they came with more heroic state  with hazel mead my naisi stood: and near our fire his bath id pour on aindles stately back the wood on ardans ox or goodly boar  though sweet that goodly mead ye think that warlike conor drinks in hall i oft have known a sweeter drink where leaps in foam the waterfall:  our board was spread beneath the tree and naisi raised the cooking flame: more sweet than honeysauced to me was meat prepared from naisis game  though well your horns may music blow though sweet each month your pipes may sound i fearless say that well i know a sweeter strain i oft have found  though horns and pipes be sounding clear though conors mind in these rejoice more magic strain more sweet more dear was usnas childrens noble voice  like sound of wave rolled naisis bass wed hear him long so sweet he sang: and ardans voice took middle place and clearly aindles tenor rang  now naisi lies within his tomb: a sorry guard his friends supplied his kindred poured his cup of doom that poisoned cup by which he died  ah berthan dear thy lands are fair thy men are proud though hills be stern: alas today i rise not there to wait for usnas sons return  that firm just mind so loved alas the dear shy youth with touch of scorn i loved with him through woods to pass and girding in the early morn  when bent on foes they boded ill those dear grey eyes that maids adored when spent with toil his troops lay still through irish woods his tenor soared  for this it is no more i sleep no more my nails with pink i stain: no joy can break the watch i keep for usnas sons come not again  for half the night no sleep i find no couch can me to rest beguile: mid crowds of thoughts still strays my mind i find no time to eat or smile  in eastern emains proud array no time to joy is left for me for gorgeous house and garments gay nor peace nor joy nor rest can be  and when conor sought to soothe her thus deirdre would answer him:  ah conor what of thee i naught can do lament and sorrow on my life have passed: the ill you fashioned lives my whole life through a little time your love for me would last  the man to me most fair beneath the sky the man i loved in death away you tore: the crime you did was great for till i die that face i loved i never shall see more  that he is gone is all my sorrow still before me looms the shape of usnas son though oer his body white is yon dark hill theres much id lavish if but him i won  i see his cheeks with meadows blush they glow black as a beetle runs his eyebrows line his lips are red and white as noble snow i see his teeth like pearls they seem to shine  well have i known the splendid garb he bears oft among albas warriors seen of old: a crimson mantle such as courtier wears and edged with border wrought of ruddy gold  of silk his tunic great its costly price for full one hundred pearls thereon are sewn stitched with findruine bright with strange device full fifty ounces weighed those threads alone  goldhilted in his hand i see his sword two spears he holds with spearheads grim and green around his shield the yellow gold is poured and in its midst a silver boss is seen  fair fergus ruin on us all hath brought we crossed the ocean and to him gave heed: his honour by a cup of ale was bought from him hath passed the fame of each high deed  if ulster on this plain were gathered here before king conor and those troops hed give id lose them all nor think the bargain dear if i with naisi usnas son could live  break not o king my heart today in me for soon though young i come my grave unto: my grief is stronger than the strength of sea thou conor knowest well my word is true  whom dost thou hate the most said conor of these whom thou now seest  thee thyself she answered and with thee eogan the son of durthacht  then said conor thou shalt dwell with eogan for a year and he gave deirdre over into eogans hand  now upon the morrow they went away over the festal plain of macha and deirdre sat behind eogan in the chariot and the two who were with her were the two men whom she would never willingly have seen together upon the earth and as she looked upon them ha deirdre said conor it is the same glance that a ewe gives when between two rams that thou sharest now between me and eogan now there was a great rock of stone in front of them and deirdre struck her head upon that stone and she shattered her head and so she died  this then is the tale of the exile of the sons of usnach and of the exile of fergus and of the death of deirdre
