there was a famous and noble king over erin named eochaid feidlech once upon a time he came over the fairgreen of bri leith and he saw at the edge of a well a woman with a bright comb of silver adorned with gold washing in a silver basin wherein were four golden birds and little bright gems of purple carbuncle in the rims of the basin a mantle she had curly and purple a beautiful cloak and in the mantle silvery fringes arranged and a brooch of fairest gold a kirtle she wore long hooded hardsmooth of green silk with red embroidery of gold marvellous clasps of gold and silver in the kirtle on her breasts and her shoulders and spaulds on every side the sun kept shining upon her so that the glistening of the gold against the sun from the green silk was manifest to men on her head were two goldenyellow tresses in each of which was a plait of four locks with a bead at the point of each lock the hue of that hair seemed to them like the flower of the iris in summer or like red gold after the burnishing thereof  there she was undoing her hair to wash it with her arms out through the sleeveholes of her smock white as the snow of one night were the two hands soft and even and red as foxglove were the two clearbeautiful cheeks dark as the back of a stagbeetle the two eyebrows like a shower of pearls were the teeth in her head blue as a hyacinth were the eyes red as rowanberries the lips very high smooth and softwhite the shoulders clearwhite and lengthy the fingers long were the hands white as the foam of a wave was the flank slender long tender smooth soft as wool polished and warm sleek and white were the two thighs round and small hard and white the two knees short and white and rulestraight the two shins justly straight and beautiful the two heels if a measure were put on the feet it would hardly have found them unequal unless the flesh of the coverings should grow upon them the bright radiance of the moon was in her noble face: the loftiness of pride in her smooth eyebrows: the light of wooing in each of her regal eyes a dimple of delight in each of her cheeks with a dappling  in them at one time of purple spots with redness of a calfs blood and at another with the bright lustre of snow soft womanly dignity in her voice a step steady and slow she had: a queenly gait was hers verily of the worlds women twas she was the dearest and loveliest and justest that the eyes of men had ever beheld it seemed to king eochaid and his followers that she was from the elfmounds of her was said: shapely are all till compared with etain dear are all till compared with etain  a longing for her straightway seized the king so he sent forward a man of his people to detain her the king asked tidings of her and said while announcing himself: shall i have an hour of dalliance with thee  tis for that we have come hither under thy safeguard quoth she  query whence art thou and whence hast thou come says eochaid  easy to say quoth she etain am i daughter of etar king of the cavalcade from the elfmounds i have been here for twenty years since i was born in an elfmound the men of the elfmound both kings and nobles have been wooing me: but nought was gotten from me because ever since i was able to speak i have loved thee and given thee a childs love for the high tales about thee and thy splendour and though i had never seen thee i knew thee at once from thy description: it is thou then i have reached  no seeking of an ill friend afar shall be thine says eochaid thou shalt have welcome and for thee every other woman shall be left by me and with thee alone will i live so long as thou hast honour  my proper brideprice to me she says and afterwards my desire  thou shalt have both says eochaid  seven cumals are given to her  footnote : ie twentyone cows  then the king even eochaid feidlech dies leaving one daughter named like her mother etain and wedded to cormac king of ulaid  after the end of a time cormac king of ulaid the man of the three gifts forsakes eochaids daughter because she was barren save for one daughter that she had borne to cormac after the making of the pottage which her mother  the woman from the elfmounds  gave her then she said to her mother: bad is what thou hast given me: it will be a daughter that i shall bear  that will not be good says her mother a kings pursuit will be on her  then cormac weds again his wife even etain and this was his desire that the daughter of the woman who had before been abandoned i e his own daughter should be killed so cormac would not leave the girl to her mother to be nursed then his two thralls take her to a pit and she smiles a laughing smile at them as they were putting her into it then their kindly nature came to them they carry her into the calfshed of the cowherds of etirscel greatgrandson of iar king of tara and they fostered her till she became a good embroideress and there was not in ireland a kings daughter dearer than she  a fenced house of wickerwork was made by the thralls for her without any door but only a window and a skylight king etercels folk espy that house and suppose that it was food the cowherds kept there but one of them went and looked through the skylight and he saw in the house the dearest beautifullest maiden this is told to the king and straightway he sends his people to break the house and carry her off without asking the cowherds for the king was childless and it had been prophesied to him by his wizards that a woman of unknown race would bear him a son  then said the king: this is the woman that has been prophesied to me  now while she was there next morning she saw a bird on the skylight coming to her and he leaves his birdskin on the floor of the house and went to her and possessed her and said: they are coming to thee from the king to wreck thy house and to bring thee to him perforce and thou wilt be pregnant by me and bear a son and that son must not kill birds and conaire son of mess buachalla shall be his name for hers was mess buachalla the cowherds fosterchild  footnote : this passage indicates the existence in ireland of totems and of the rule that the person to whom a totem belongs must not kill the totemanimal  ws  and then she was brought to the king and with her went her fosterers and she was betrothed to the king and he gave her seven cumals and to her fosterers seven other cumals and afterwards they were made chieftains so that they all became legitimate whence are the two fedlimthi rechtaidi and then she bore a son to the king even conaire son of mess buachalla and these were her three urgent prayers to the king to wit the nursing of her son among three households that is the fosterers who had nurtured her and the two honeyworded maines and she herself is the third and she said that such of the men of erin as should wish to do aught for this boy should give to those three households for the boys protection  so in that wise he was reared and the men of erin straightway knew this boy on the day he was born and other boys were fostered with him to wit fer le and fer gar and fer rogein three greatgrandsons of donn desa the champion an armyman of the army from muclesi  now conaire possessed three gifts to wit the gift of hearing and the gift of eyesight and the gift of judgment and of those three gifts he taught one to each of his three fosterbrothers and whatever meal was prepared for him the four of them would go to it even though three meals were prepared for him each of them would go to his meal the same raiment and armour and colour of horses had the four  then the king even eterscele died a bullfeast is gathered by the men of erin in order to determine their future king that is a bull used to be killed by them and thereof one man would eat his fill and drink its broth and a spell of truth was chanted over him in his bed whosoever he would see in his sleep would be king and the sleeper would perish if he uttered a falsehood  four men in chariots were on the plain of liffey at their game conaire himself and his three fosterbrothers then his fosterers went to him that he might repair to the bullfeast the bullfeaster then in his sleep at the end of the night beheld a man starknaked passing along the road of tara with a stone in his sling  i will go in the morning after you quoth he  he left his fosterbrothers at their game and turned his chariot and his charioteer until he was in dublin there he saw great whitespeckled birds of unusual size and colour and beauty he pursues them until his horses were tired the birds would go a spearcast before him and would not go any further he alighted and takes his sling for them out of the chariot he goes after them until he was at the sea the birds betake themselves to the wave he went to them and overcame them the birds quit their birdskins and turn upon him with spears and swords one of them protects him and addressed him saying: i am nemglan king of thy fathers birds and thou hast been forbidden to cast at birds for here there is no one that should not be dear to thee because of his father or mother  till today says conaire i knew not this  go to tara tonight says nemglan tis fittest for thee a bull feast is there and through it thou shalt be king a man starknaked who shall go at the end of the night along one of the roads of tara having a stone and a sling  tis he that shall be king  so in this wise conaire fared forth and on each of the four roads whereby men go to tara there were three kings awaiting him and they had raiment for him since it had been foretold that he would come starknaked then he was seen from the road on which his fosterers were and they put royal raiment about him and placed him in a chariot and he bound his pledges  the folk of tara said to him: it seems to us that our bullfeast and our spell of truth are a failure if it be only a young beardless lad that we have visioned therein  that is of no moment quoth he for a young generous king like me to be in the kingship is no disgrace since the binding of taras pledges is mine by right of father and grandsire  excellent excellent says the host they set the kingship of erin upon him and he said: i will enquire of wise men that i myself may be wise  then he uttered all this as he had been taught by the man at the wave who said this to him: thy reign will be subject to a restriction but the birdreign will be noble and this shall be thy restriction ie thy tabu  thou shalt not go righthandwise round tara and lefthandwise round bregia  the evilbeasts of cerna must not be hunted by thee  and thou shalt not go out every ninth night beyond tara  thou shalt not sleep in a house from which firelight is manifest outside after sunset and in which light is manifest from without  and three reds shall not go before thee to reds house  and no rapine shall be wrought in thy reign  and after sunset a company of one woman or one man shall not enter the house in which thou art  and thou shalt not settle the quarrel of thy two thralls  now there were in his reign great bounties to wit seven ships in every june in every year arriving at inver colptha and oakmast up to the knees in every autumn and plenty of fish in the rivers bush and boyne in the june of each year and such abundance of good will that no one slew another in erin during his reign and to every one in erin his fellows voice seemed as sweet as the strings of lutes from midspring to midautumn no wind disturbed a cows tail his reign was neither thunderous nor stormy  footnote : the mouth of the river boyne  ws  now his fosterbrothers murmured at the taking from them of their fathers and their grandsires gifts namely theft and robbery and slaughter of men and rapine they thieved the three thefts from the same man to wit a swine and an ox and a cow every year that they might see what punishment therefor the king would inflict upon them and what damage the theft in his reign would cause to the king  now every year the farmer would come to the king to complain and the king would say to him go thou and address donn desas three great grandsons for tis they that have taken the beasts whenever he went to speak to donn desas descendants they would almost kill him and he would not return to the king lest conaire should attend his hurt  since then pride and wilfulness possessed them they took to marauding surrounded by the sons of the lords of the men of erin thrice fifty men had they as pupils when they the pupils were werewolfing in the province of connaught until maine milscothachs swineherd saw them and he had never seen that before he went in flight when they heard him they pursued him the swineherd shouted and the people of the two maines came to him and the thrice fifty men were arrested along with their auxiliaries and taken to tara they consulted the king concerning the matter and he said: let each father slay his son but let my fosterlings be spared  leave leave says every one: it shall be done for thee  nay indeed quoth he no cast of life by me is the doom i have delivered the men shall not be hung but let veterans go with them that they may wreak their rapine on the men of alba  this they do thence they put to sea and met the son of the king of britain even ingcel the oneeyed grandson of conmac: thrice fifty men and their veterans they met upon the sea  they make an alliance and go with ingcel and wrought rapine with him  this is the destruction which his own impulse gave him that was the night that his mother and his father and his seven brothers had been bidden to the house of the king of his district all of them were destroyed by ingcel in a single night then the irish pirates put out to sea to the land of erin to seek a destruction as payment for that to which ingcel had been entitled from them  in conaires reign there was perfect peace in erin save that in thomond there was a joining of battle between the two carbres two fosterbrothers of his were they and until conaire came it was impossible to make peace between them twas a tabu of his to go to separate them before they had repaired to him he went however although to do so was one of his tabus and he made peace between them he remained five nights with each of the two that also was a tabu of his  after settling the two quarrels he was travelling to tara this is the way they took to tara past usnech of meath and they saw the raiding from east and west and from south and north and they saw the warbands and the hosts and the men starknaked and the land of the southern oneills was a cloud of fire around him  what is this asked conaire easy to say his people answer easy to know that the kings law has broken down therein since the country has begun to burn  whither shall we betake ourselves says conaire  to the northeast says his people  so then they went righthandwise round tara and lefthandwise round bregia and the evil beasts of cerna were hunted by him but he saw it not till the chase had ended  they that made of the world that smoky mist of magic were elves and they did so because conaires tabus had been violated  great fear then fell on conaire because they had no way to wend save upon the road of midluachair and the road of cualu  so they took their way by the coast of ireland southward  then said conaire on the road of cualu: whither shall we go tonight  may i succeed in telling thee my fosterling conaire says mac cecht son of snade teiched the champion of conaire son of eterscel oftener have the men of erin been contending for thee every night than thou hast been wandering about for a guesthouse  judgment goes with good times says conaire i had a friend in this country if only we knew the way to his house  what is his name asked mac cecht  da derga of leinster answered conaire he came unto me to seek a gift from me and he did not come with a refusal i gave him a hundred kine of the drove i gave him a hundred fatted swine i gave him a hundred mantles made of close cloth i gave him a hundred bluecoloured weapons of battle i gave him ten red gilded brooches i gave him ten vats good and brown i gave him ten thralls i gave him ten querns i gave him thrice nine hounds allwhite in their silvern chains i gave him a hundred racehorses in the herds of deer there would be no abatement in his case though he should come again he would make return it is strange if he is surly to me tonight when reaching his abode  when i was acquainted with his house says mac cecht the road whereon thou art going towards him was the boundary of his abode it continues till it enters his house for through the house passes the road there are seven doorways into the house and seven bedrooms between every two doorways but there is only one doorvalve on it and that valve is turned to every doorway to which the wind blows  with all that thou hast here says conaire thou shalt go in thy great multitude until thou alight in the midst of the house  if so be answers mac cecht that thou goest thither i go on that i may strike fire there ahead of thee  when conaire after this was journeying along the road of cualu he marked before him three horsemen riding towards the house three red frocks had they and three red mantles: three red bucklers they bore and three red spears were in their hands: three red steeds they bestrode and three red heads of hair were on them red were they all both body and hair and raiment both steeds and men  who is it that fares before us asked conaire it was a tabu of mine for those three to go before me  the three reds to the house of red who will follow them and tell them to come towards me in my track  i will follow them says le fri flaith conaires son  he goes after them lashing his horse and overtook them not there was the length of a spearcast between them: but they did not gain upon him and he did not gain upon them  he told them not to go before the king he overtook them not but one of the three men sang a lay to him over his shoulder:  lo my son great the news news from a hostel    lo my son  they go away from him then: he could not detain them  the boy waited for the host he told his father what was said to him conaire liked it not after them thou says conaire and offer them three oxen and three baconpigs and so long as they shall be in my household no one shall be among them from fire to wall  so the lad goes after them and offers them that and overtook them not but one of the three men sang a lay to him over his shoulder:  lo my son great the news a generous kings great ardour whets thee burns thee through ancient mens enchantments a company of nine yields lo my son  the boy turns back and repeated the lay to conaire  go after them says conaire and offer them six oxen and six bacon pigs and my leavings and gifts tomorrow and so long as they shall be in my household no one to be among them from fire to wall  the lad then went after them and overtook them not but one of the three men answered and said:  lo my son great the news weary are the steeds we ride we ride the steeds of donn tetscorach from the elfmounds though we are alive we are dead great are the signs: destruction of life: sating of ravens: feeding of crows strife of slaughter: wetting of swordedge shields with broken bosses in hours after sundown lo my son  then they go from him  i see that thou hast not detained the men says conaire  indeed it is not i that betrayed it says le fri flaith  he recited the last answer that they gave him conaire and his retainers were not blithe thereat: and afterwards evil forebodings of terror were on them  all my tabus have seized me tonight says conaire since those three reds are the banished folks  footnote : they had been banished from the elfmounds and for them to precede conaire was to violate one of his taboos  ws  they went forward to the house and took their seats therein and fastened their red steeds to the door of the house  that is the forefaring of the three reds in the bruden da derga  this is the way that conaire took with his troops to dublin     tis then the man of the black cropt hair with his one hand and one eye and one foot overtook them rough cropt hair upon him though a sackful of wild apples were flung on his crown not an apple would fall on the ground but each of them would stick on his hair though his snout were flung on a branch they would remain together long and thick as an outer yoke was each of his two shins each of his buttocks was the size of a cheese on a withe a forked pole of iron blackpointed was in his hand a swine blackbristled singed was on his back squealing continually and a woman bigmouthed huge dark sorry hideous was behind him though her snout were flung on a branch the branch would support it her lower lip would reach her knee  he starts forward to meet conaire and made him welcome welcome to thee o master conaire long hath thy coming hither been known  who gives the welcome asks conaire  fer caille here with his black swine for thee to consume that thou be not fasting tonight for tis thou art the best king that has come into the world  what is thy wifes name says conaire  cichuil he answers  any other night says conaire that pleases you i will come to you and leave us alone tonight  nay say the churl for we will go to thee to the place wherein thou wilt be tonight o fair little master conaire  so he goes towards the house with his great bigmouthed wife behind him and his swine shortbristled black singed squealing continually on his back that was one of conaires tabus and that plunder should be taken in ireland during his reign was another tabu of his  now plunder was taken by the sons of donn desa and five hundred there were in the body of their marauders besides what underlings were with them this too was a tabu of conaires there was a good warrior in the north country wain over withered sticks this was his name why he was so called was because he used to go over his opponent even as a wain would go over withered sticks now plunder was taken by him and there were five hundred in the body of their marauders alone besides underlings  there was after that a troop of still haughtier heroes namely the seven sons of ailill and medb each of whom was called mane and each mane had a nickname to wit mane fatherlike and mane motherlike and mane gentlepious mane verypious mane unslow and mane honeyworded mane graspthemall and mane the loquacious rapine was wrought by them as to mane motherlike and mane unslow there were fourteen score in the body of their marauders mane fatherlike had three hundred and fifty mane honeyworded had five hundred mane graspthemall had seven hundred mane the loquacious had seven hundred each of the others had five hundred in the body of his marauders  there was a valiant trio of the men of cualu of leinster namely the three red hounds of cualu called cethach and clothach and conall now rapine was wrought by them and twelve score were in the body of their marauders and they had a troop of madmen in conaires reign a third of the men of ireland were reavers he was of sufficient strength and power to drive them out of the land of erin so as to transfer their marauding to the other side great britain but after this transfer they returned to their country  when they had reached the shoulder of the sea they meet ingcel the one eyed and eiccel and tulchinne three greatgrandsons of conmac of britain on the raging of the sea a man ungentle huge fearful uncouth was ingcel a single eye in his head as broad as an oxhide as black as a chafer with three pupils therein thirteen hundred were in the body of his marauders the marauders of the men of erin were more numerous than they  they go for a seaencounter on the main ye should not do this says ingcel: do not break the truth of men fair play upon us for ye are more in number than i  nought but a combat on equal terms shall befall thee say the reavers of erin  there is somewhat better for you quoth ingcel let us make peace since ye have been cast out of the land of erin and we have been cast out of the land of alba and britain let us make an agreement between us come ye and wreak your rapine in my country and i will go with you and wreak my rapine in your country  they follow this counsel and they gave pledges therefor from this side and from that there are the sureties that were given to ingcel by the men of erin namely fer gair and gabur or fer lee and fer rogain for the destruction that ingcel should choose to cause in ireland and for the destruction that the sons of donn desa should choose in alba and britain  a lot was cast upon them to see with which of them they should go first it fell that they should go with ingcel to his country so they made for britain and there his father and mother and his seven brothers were slain as we have said before thereafter they made for alba and there they wrought the destruction and then they returned to erin  tis then now that conaire son of eterscel went towards the hostel along the road of cualu  tis then that the reavers came till they were in the sea off the coast of bregia overagainst howth  then said the reavers: strike the sails and make one band of you on the sea that ye may not be sighted from land and let some lightfoot be found from among you to go on shore to see if we could save our honors with ingcel a destruction for the destruction he has given us  who will go on shore to listen let some one ago says ingcel who should have there the three gifts namely gift of hearing gift of far sight and gift of judgment  i says mane honeyworded have the gift of hearing  and i says mane unslow have the gift of far sight and of judgment  tis well for you to go thus say the reavers: good is that wise  then nine men go on till they were on the hill of howth to know what they might hear and see  be still a while says mane honeyworded  what is that asks mane unslow  the sound of a good kings cavalcade i hear  by the gift of far sight i see quoth his comrade  what seest thou here  i see there quoth he cavalcades splendid lofty beautiful warlike foreign somewhat slender weary active keen whetted vehement a good course that shakes a great covering of land they fare to many heights with wondrous waters and invers  footnote : mouths of rivers  what are the waters and heights and invers that they traverse  easy to say: indeoin cult cuilten mafat ammat iarmafat finne goiste

eterscel with multitudes of the men of erin around him who has travelled the road  back then they go that they may tell it to the reavers this they say is what we have heard and seen  of this host then there was a multitude both on this side and on that namely thrice fifty boats with five thousand in them and ten hundred in every thousand then they hoisted the sails on the boats and steer them thence to shore till they landed on the strand of fuirbthe  when the boats reached land then was mac cecht astriking fire in da dergas hostel at the sound of the spark the thrice fifty boats were hurled out so that they were on the shoulders of the sea  be silent a while said ingcel liken thou that o fer rogain  i know not answers fer rogain unless it is luchdonn the satirist in emain macha who makes this handsmiting when his food is taken from him perforce: or the scream of luchdonn in temair luachra: of mac cechts striking a spark when he kindles a fire before a king of erin where he sleeps every spark and every shower which his fire would let fall on the floor would broil a hundred calves and two halfpigs  may god not bring that man even conaire there tonight say donn desas sons sad that he is under the hurt of foes  meseems says ingcel it should be no sadder for me than the destruction i gave you this were my feast that conaire should chance to come there  their fleet is steered to land the noise that the thrice fifty vessels made in running ashore shook da dergas hostel so that no spear nor shield remained on rack therein but the weapons uttered a cry and fell all on the floor of the house  liken thou that o conaire says every one: what is this noise  i know nothing like it unless it be the earth that has broken or the leviathan that surrounds the globe and strikes with its tail to overturn the world or the barque of the sons of donn desa that has reached the shore alas that it should not be they who are there beloved fosterbrothers of our own were they dear were the champions we should not have feared them tonight  then came conaire so that he was on the green of the hostel  when mac cecht heard the tumultuous noise it seemed to him that warriors had attacked his people thereat he leapt on to his armour to help them vast as the thunderfeat of three hundred did they deem his game in leaping to his weapons thereof there was no profit  now in the bow of the ship wherein were donn desas sons was the champion greataccoutred wrathful the lion hard and awful ingcel the one eyed greatgrandson of conmac wide as an oxhide was the single eye protruding from his forehead with seven pupils therein which were black as a chafer each of his knees as big as strippers caldron each of his two fists was the size of a reapingbasket: his buttocks as big as a cheese on a withe: each of his shins as long as an outer yoke  so after that the thrice fifty boats and those five thousands  with ten hundred in every thousand  landed on the strand of fuirbthe  then conaire with his people entered the hostel and each took his seat within both tabu and nontabu and the three reds took their seats and fer caille with his swine took his seat  thereafter da derga came to them with thrice fifty warriors each of them having a long head of hair to the hollow of his polls and a short cloak to their buttocks speckledgreen drawers they wore and in their hands were thrice fifty great clubs of thorn with bands of iron  welcome o master conaire quoth he though the bulk of the men of erin were to come with thee they themselves would have a welcome  when they were there they saw a lone woman coming to the door of the hostel after sunset and seeking to be let in as long as a weavers beam was each of her two shins and they were as dark as the back of a stagbeetle a greyish wooly mantle she wore her lower hair used to reach as far as her knee her lips were on one side of her head  she came and put one of her shoulders against the doorpost of the house casting the evil eye on the king and the youths who surrounded him in the hostel he himself addressed her from within  well o woman says conaire if thou art a wizard what seest thou for us  truly i see for thee she answers that neither fell nor flesh of thine shall escape from the place into which thou hast come save what birds will bear away in their claws  it was not an evil omen we foreboded o woman saith he: it is not thou that always augurs for us what is thy name o woman  calib she answers  that is not much of a name says conaire  lo many are my names besides  which be they asks conaire  easy to say quoth she samon sinand seisclend sodb caill coll dichoem dichiuil dithim dichuimne dichruidne dairne darine deruaine egem agam ethamne gnim cluiche cethardam nith nemain noennen badb blosc bloar huae oe aife la sruth mache mede mod  on one foot and holding up one hand and breathing one breath she sang all that to them from the door of the house  i swear by the gods whom i adore says conaire that i will call thee by none of these names whether i shall be here a long or a short time  what dost thou desire says conaire  that which thou too desirest she answered  tis a tabu of mine says conaire to receive the company of one woman after sunset  though it be a tabu she replied i will not go until my guesting come at once this very night  tell her says conaire that an ox and a baconpig shall be taken out to her and my leavings: provided that she stays tonight in some other place  if in sooth she says it has befallen the king not to have room in his house for the meal and bed of a solitary woman they will be gotten apart from him from some one possessing generosity  if the hospitality of the prince in the hostel has departed  savage is the answer says conaire let her in though it is a tabu of mine  great loathing they felt after that from the womans converse and ill foreboding but they knew not the cause thereof  the reavers afterwards landed and fared forth till they were at lecca cinn slebe ever open was the hostel why it was called a bruden was because it resembles the lips of a man blowing a fire  great was the fire which was kindled by conaire every night to wit a boar of the wood seven outlets it had when a log was cut out of its side every flame that used to come forth at each outlet was as big as the blaze of a burning oratory there were seventeen of conaires chariots at every door of the house and by those that were looking from the vessels that great light was clearly seen through the wheels of the chariots  canst thou say o fer rogain what that great light yonder resembles  i cannot liken it to aught answers fer rogain unless it be the fire of a king may god not bring that man there tonight tis a pity to destroy him  what then deemest thou says ingcel of that mans reign in the land of erin  good is his reign replied fer rogain since he assumed the kingship no cloud has veiled the sun for the space of a day from the middle of spring to the middle of autumn and not a dewdrop fell from grass till midday and wind would not touch a beasts tail until nones and in his reign from years end to years end no wolf has attacked aught save one bullcalf of each byre and to maintain this rule there are seven wolves in hostageship at the sidewall in his house and behind this a further security even maclocc and tis he that pleads for them in conaires house in conaires reign are the three crowns on erin namely crown of cornears and crown of flowers and crown of oak mast in his reign too each man deems the others voice as melodious as the strings of lutes because of the excellence of the law and the peace and the goodwill prevailing throughout erin may god not bring that man there tonight tis sad to destroy him tis a branch through its blossom tis a swine that falls before mast tis an infant in age sad is the shortness of his life  this was my luck says ingcel that he should be there and there should be one destruction for another it were not more grievous to me than my father and my mother and my seven brothers and the king of my country whom i gave up to you before coming on the transfer of the rapine  tis true tis true say the evildoers who were along with the reavers  the reavers make a start from the strand of fuirbthe and bring a stone for each man to make a cairn for this was the distinction which at first the fians made between a destruction and a rout a pillarstone they used to plant when there would be a rout a cairn however they used to make when there would be a destruction at this time then they made a cairn for it was a destruction far from the house was this that they might not be heard or seen therefrom  for two causes they built their cairn namely first since this was a custom in marauding and secondly that they might find out their losses at the hostel every one that would come safe from it would take his stone from the cairn: thus the stones of those that were slain would be left and thence they would know their losses and this is what men skilled in story recount that for every stone in carn leca there was one of the reavers killed at the hostel from that cairn leca in hui cellaig is so called  a boar of a fire is kindled by the sons of donn desa to give warning to conaire so that is the first warningbeacon that has been made in erin and from it to this day every warningbeacon is kindled  this is what others recount: that it was on the eve of samain allsaintsday the destruction of the hostel was wrought and that from yonder beacon the beacon of samain is followed from that to this and stones are placed is the samainfire  then the reavers framed a counsel at the place where they had put the cairn  well then says ingcel to the guides what is nearest to us here  easy to say: the hostel of hua derga chiefhospitaller of erin  good men indeed says ingcel were likely to seek their fellows at that hostel tonight  this then was the counsel of the reavers to send one of them to see how things were there  who will go there to espy the house say everyone  who should go says ingcel but i for tis i that am entitled to dues  ingcel went to reconnoitre the hostel with one of the seven pupils of the single eye which stood out of his forehead to fit his eye into the house in order to destroy the king and the youths who were around him therein and ingcel saw them through the wheels of the chariots  then ingcel was perceived from the house he made a start from it after being perceived  he went till he reached the reavers in the stead wherein they were each circle of them was set around another to hear the tidings  the chiefs of the reavers being in the very centre of the circles there were fer ger and fer gel and fer rogel and fer rogain and lomna the buffoon and ingcel the oneeyed  six in the centre of the circles and fer rogain went to question ingcel  how is that o ingcel asks fer rogain  however it be answered ingcel royal is the custom hostful is the tumult: kingly is the noise thereof whether a king be there or not i will take the house for what i have a right to thence my turn of rapine cometh  we have left it in thy hand o ingcel say conaires fosterbrothers but we should not wreak the destruction till we know who may be therein  question hast thou seen the house well o ingcel asks fer rogain  mine eye cast a rapid glance around it and i will accept it for my dues as it stands  thou mayest well accept it o ingcel saith fer rogain: the foster father of us all is there erins overking conaire son of eterscel  question what sawest thou in the champions high seat of the house facing the king on the opposite side  the room of cormac condlongas  i saw there says ingcel a man of noble countenance large with a clear and sparkling eye an even set of teeth a face narrow below broad above fair flaxen golden hair upon him and a proper fillet around it a brooch of silver in his mantle and in his hand a goldhilted sword a shield with five golden circles upon it: a fivebarbed javelin in his hand a visage just fair ruddy he hath: he is also beardless modestminded is that man  and after that whom sawest thou there  the room of cormacs nine comrades  there i saw three men to the west of cormac and three to the east of him and three in front of the same man thou wouldst deem that the nine of them had one mother and one father they are of the same age equally goodly equally beautiful all alike thin rods of gold in their mantles bent shields of bronze they bear ribbed javelins above them an ivoryhilted sword in the hand of each an unique feat they have to wit each of them takes his swords point between his two fingers and they twirl the swords round their fingers and the swords afterwards extend themselves by themselves liken thou that o fer rogain says ingcel  easy says fer rogain for me to liken them it is conchobars son cormac condlongas the best hero behind a shield in the land of erin of modest mind is that boy evil is what he dreads tonight he is a champion of valour for feats of arms he is an hospitaller for householding these are yon nine who surround him the three dungusses and the three doelgusses and the three dangusses the nine comrades of cormac condlongas son of conchobar they have never slain men on account of their misery and they never spared them on account of their prosperity good is the hero who is among them even cormac condlongas i swear what my tribe swears nine times ten will fall by cormac in his first onset and nine times ten will fall by his people besides a man for each of their weapons and a man for each of themselves and cormac will share prowess with any man before the hostel and he will boast of victory over a king or crownprince or noble of the reavers and he himself will chance to escape though all his people be wounded  woe to him who shall wreak this destruction says lomna druth even because of that one man cormac condlongas son of conchobar i swear what my tribe swears says lomna son of donn desa if i could fulfil my counsel the destruction would not be attempted were it only because of that one man and because of the heros beauty and goodness  it is not feasible to prevent it says ingcel: clouds of weakness come to you a keen ordeal which will endanger two cheeks of a goat will be opposed by the oath of fer rogain who will run thy voice o lomna says ingcel hath taken breaking upon thee: thou art a worthless warrior and i know thee clouds of weakness come to you     neither old men nor historians shall declare that i quitted the destruction until i shall wreak it  reproach not our honour o ingcel say ger and gabur and fer rogain the destruction shall be wrought unless the earth break under it until all of us are slain thereby  truly then thou hast reason o ingcel says lomna druth son of donn desa not to thee is the loss caused by the destruction thou wilt carry off the head of the king of a foreign country with thy slaughter of another and thou and thy brothers will escape from the destruction even ingcel and ecell and the yearling of the rapine  harder however it is for me says lomna druth: woe is me before every one woe is me after every one tis my head that will be first tossed about there tonight after an hour among the chariotshafts where devilish foes will meet it will be flung into the hostel thrice and thrice will it be flung forth woe to him that comes woe to him with whom one goes woe to him to whom one goes wretches are they that go wretches are they to whom they go  there is nothing that will come to me says ingcel in place of my mother and my father and my seven brothers and the king of my district whom ye destroyed with me there is nothing that i shall not endure henceforward  though a    should go through them say ger and gabur and fer rogain the destruction will be wrought by thee tonight  woe to him who shall put them under the hands of foes says lomna and whom sawest thou afterwards  the room of the picts this  i saw another room there with a huge trio in it: three brown big men: three round heads of hair on them even equally long at nape and forehead three short black cowls about them reaching to their elbows: long hoods were on the cowls three black huge swords they had and three black shields they bore with three dark broadgreen javelins above them thick as the spit of a caldron was the shaft of each liken thou that o fer rogain  hard it is for me to find their like i know not in erin that trio unless it be yon trio of pictland who went into exile from their country and are now in conaires household these are their names: dublonges son of trebuat and trebuat son of hualonsce and curnach son of hua faich the three who are best in pictland at taking arms are that trio nine decads will fall at their hands in their first encounter and a man will fall for each of their weapons besides one for each of themselves and they will share prowess with every trio in the hostel they will boast a victory over a king or a chief of the reavers and they will afterwards escape though wounded woe to him who shall wreak the destruction though it be only on account of those three  says lomna druth: i swear to god what my tribe swears if my counsel were taken the destruction would never be wrought  ye cannot says ingcel: clouds of weakness are coming to you a keen ordeal which will endanger etc and whom slowest thou there afterwards  the room of the pipers  there i beheld a room with nine men in it hair fair and yellow was on them: they all are equally beautiful mantles speckled with colour they wore and above them were nine bagpipes fourturned ornamented enough light in the palace were the ornament on these fourtuned pipes liken thou them o fer rogain  easy for me to liken them says fer rogain those are the nine pipers that came to conaire out of the elfmound of bregia because of noble tales about

and a man for each of themselves and each of them will boast a victory over a king or a chief of the reavers and they will escape from the destruction for a conflict with them will be a conflict with shadow they will slay but they will not be slain for they are out of an elfmound woe to him who shall wreak the destruction though it be only because of those nine  ye cannot says ingcel clouds of weakness come to you etc and after that whom sawest thou there  the room of conaires majordomo  there i saw a room with one man in it rough cropt hair upon him though a sack of crabapples should be flung on his head not one of them would fall on the floor but every apple would stick on his hair his fleecy mantle was over him in the house every quarrel therein about seat or bed comes to his decision should a needle drop in the house its fall would be heard when he speaks above him is a huge black tree like a millshaft with its paddles and its cap and its spike liken thou him o fer rogain  easy for me is this tuidle of ulaid is he the steward of conaires household tis needful to hearken to the decision of that man the man that rules seat and bed and food for each tis his household staff that is above him that man will fight with you i swear what my tribe swears the dead at the destruction slain by him will be more numerous that the living thrice his number will fall by him and he himself will fall there woe to him who shall wreak the destruction etc  ye cannot says ingcel clouds of weakness come upon you what sawest thou there after that     there i beheld another room with a trio in it three halffurious nobles: the biggest of them in the middle very noisy    rockbodied angry smiting dealing strong blows who beats nine hundred in battleconflict a wooden shield dark covered with iron he bears with a hard    rim a shield whereon would fit the proper litter of four troops of ten weaklings on its    of    leather a    boss thereon the depth of a caldron fit to cook four oxen a hollow maw a great boiling with four swine in its midmaw great    at his two smooth sides are two fivethwarted boats fit for three parties of ten in each of his two strong fleets  a spear he hath bluered handfitting on its puissant shaft it stretches along the wall on the roof and rests on the ground an iron point upon it darkred dripping four amplymeasured feet between the two points of its edge  thirty amplymeasured feet in his deadlystriking sword from dark point to iron hilt it shews forth fiery sparks which illumine the midcourt house from roof to ground  tis a strong countenance that i see a swoon from horror almost befell me while staring at those three there is nothing stranger  two bare hills were there by the man with hair two loughs by a mountain of the    of a bluefronted wave: two hides by a tree two boats near them full of thorns of a white thorn tree on a circular board and there seems to me somewhat like a slender stream of water on which the sun is shining and its trickle down from it and a hide arranged behind it and a palace housepost shaped like a great lance above it a good weight of a ploughyoke is the shaft that is therein liken thou that o fer rogain  easy meseems to liken him that is mac cecht son of snaide teichid the battlesoldier of conaire son of eterscel good is the hero mac cecht supine he was in his room in his sleep when thou beheldest him the two bare hills which thou sawest by the man with hair these are his two knees by his head the two loughs by the mountain which thou sawest these are his two eyes by his nose the two hides by a tree which thou sawest these are his two ears by his head the two fivethwarted boats on a circular board which thou sawest these are his two sandals on his shield the slender stream of water which thou sawest whereon the sun shines and its trickle down from it this is the flickering of his sword the hide which thou sawest arranged behind him that is his swords scabbard the palace housepost which thou sawest that is his lance: and he brandishes this spear till its two ends meet and he hurls a wilful cast of it when he pleases good is the hero mac cecht  six hundred will fall by him in his first encounter and a man for each of his weapons besides a man for himself and he will share prowess with every one in the hostel and he will boast of triumph over a king or chief of the reavers in front of the hostel he will chance to escape though wounded and when he shall chance to come upon you out of the house as numerous as hailstones and grass on a green and stars of heaven will be your cloven heads and skulls and the clots of your brains your bones and the heaps of your bowels crushed by him and scattered throughout the ridges  then with trembling and terror of mac cecht they flee over three ridges  they took the pledges among them again even ger and gabur and fer rogain  woe to him that shall wreak the destruction says lomna druth your heads will depart from you  ye cannot says ingcel: clouds of weakness are coming to you etc  true indeed o ingcel says lomna druth son of donn desa not unto thee is the loss caused by the destruction woe is me for the destruction for the first head that will reach the hostel will be mine  tis harder for me says ingcel: tis my destruction that has been    there  truly then says ingcel maybe i shall be the corpse that is frailest there etc  and afterwards whom sawest thou there  the room of conaires three sons oball and oblin and corpre  there i beheld a room with a trio in it to wit three tender striplings wearing three silken mantles in their mantles were three golden brooches three goldenyellow manes were on them when they undergo headcleansing their goldenyellow mane reaches the edge of their haunches when they raise their eye it raises the hair so that it is not lower than the tips of their ears and it is as curly as a rams head a    of gold and a palaceflambeau above each of them every one who is in the house spares them voice and deed and word liken thou that o fer rogain says ingcel  fer rogain wept so that his mantle in front of him became moist and no voice was gotten out of his head till a third of the night had passed  o little ones says fer rogain i have good reason for what i do those are three sons of the king of erin: oball and obline and corpre findmor  it grieves us if the tale be true say the sons of donn desa good is the trio in that room manners of ripe maidens have they and hearts of brothers and valours of bears and furies of lions whosoever is in their company and in their couch and parts from them he sleeps not and eats not at ease till the end of nine days from lack of their companionship good are the youths for their age thrice ten will fall by each of them in their first encounter and a man for each weapon and three men for themselves and one of the three will fall there because of that trio woe to him that shall wreak the destruction  ye cannot says ingcel: clouds of weakness are coming to you etc and whom sawest thou afterwards  the room of the fomorians  i beheld there a room with a trio in it to wit a trio horrible unheard  of a triad of champions etc  liken thou that o fer rogain  tis hard for me to liken that trio neither of the men of erin nor of the men of the world do i know it unless it be the trio that mac cecht brought out of the land of the fomorians by dint of duels not one of the fomorians was found to fight him so he brought away those three and they are in conaires house as sureties that while conaire is reigning the fomorians destroy neither corn nor milk in erin beyond their fair tribute well may their aspect be loathy three rows of teeth in their heads from one ear to another an ox with a baconpig this is the ration of each of them and that ration which they put into their mouths is visible till it comes down past their navels bodies of bone ie without a joint in them all those three have i swear what my tribe swears more will be killed by them at the destruction than those they leave alive six hundred warriors will fall by them in their first conflict and a man for each of their weapons and one for each of the three themselves and they will boast a triumph over a king or chief of the reavers it will not be more than with a bite or a blow or a kick that each of those men will kill for no arms are allowed them in the house since they are in hostageship at the wall lest they do a misdeed therein i swear what my tribe swears if they had armour on them they would slay us all but a third woe to him that shall wreak the destruction because it is not a combat against sluggards  ye cannot says ingcel etc and whom sawest thou there after that  the room of munremar son of gerrchenn birderg son of ruan mal son of telband  i beheld a room there with a trio in it three brown big men with three brown heads of short hair thick calfbottoms ankles they had as thick as a mans waist was each of their limbs three brown and curled masses of hair upon them with a thick head: three cloaks red and speckled they wore: three black shields with clasps of gold and three fivebarbed javelins and each had in hand an ivoryhilted sword this is the feat they perform with their swords: they throw them high up and they throw the scabbards after them and the swords before reaching the ground place themselves in the scabbards then they throw the scabbards first and the swords after them and the scabbards meet the swords and place themselves round them before they reach the ground liken thou that o fer rogain  easy for me to liken them mal son of telband and munremar son of gerrchenn and birderg son of ruan three crownprinces three champions of valour three heroes the best behind weapons in erin a hundred heroes will fall by them in their first conflict and they will share prowess with every man in the hostel and they will boast of the victory over a king or chief of the reavers and afterwards they will chance to escape the destruction should not be wrought even because of those three  woe to him that shall wreak the destruction says lomna better were the victory of saving them than the victory of slaying them happy he who should save them woe to him that shall slay them  it is not feasible says ingcel etc and afterwards whom sawest thou  the room of conall cernach  there i beheld in a decorated room the fairest man of erins heroes he wore a tufted purple cloak white as snow was one of his cheeks the other was red and speckled like foxglove blue as hyacinth was one of his eyes dark as a stagbeetles back was the other the bushy head of fair golden hair upon him was as large as a reapingbasket and it touches the edge of his haunches it is as curly as a rams head if a sackful of redshelled nuts were spilt on the crown of his head not one of them would fall on the floor but remain on the hooks and plaits and swordlets of their hair a gold hilted sword in his hand a bloodred shield which has been speckled with rivets of white bronze between plates of gold a long heavy threeridged spear: as thick as an outer yoke is the shaft that is in it liken thou that o fer rogain  easy for me to liken him for the men of erin know that scion that is conall cernach son of amorgen he has chanced to be along with conaire at this time tis he whom conaire loves beyond every one because of his resemblance to him in goodness of form and shape goodly is the hero that is there conall cernach to that bloodred shield on his fist which has been speckled with rivets of white bronze the ulaid have given a famous name to wit the bricriu of conall cernach  i swear what my tribe swears plenteous will be the rain of red blood over it tonight before the hostel that ridged spear above him many will there be unto whom tonight before the hostel it will deal drinks of death seven doorways there are out of the house and conall cernach will contrive to be each of them and from no doorway will he be absent three hundred will fall by conall in his first conflict besides a man for each of his weapons and one for himself he will share prowess with every one in the hostel and when he shall happen to sally upon you from the house as numerous as hailstones and grass on green and stars of heaven will be your halfheads and cloven skulls and your bones under the point of his sword he will succeed in escaping though wounded woe to him that shall wreak the destruction were it but for this man only  ye cannot says ingcel clouds etc  and after that whom sawest thou  the room of conaire himself  there i beheld a room more beautifully decorated than the other rooms of the house a silvery curtain around it and there were ornaments in the room i beheld a trio in it the outer two of them were both of them fair with their hair and eyelashes and they are as bright as snow a very lovely blush on the cheek of each of the twain a tender lad in the midst between them the ardour and energy of a king has he and the counsel of a sage the mantle i saw around him is even as the mist of mayday diverse are the hue and semblance each moment shewn upon it lovelier is each hue than the other in front of him in the mantle i beheld a wheel of gold which reached from his chin to his navel the colour of his hair was like the sheen of smelted gold of all the worlds forms that i beheld this is the most beautiful i saw his goldenhilted glaive down beside him a forearms length of the sword was outside the scabbard that forearm a man down in the front of the house could see a fleshworm by the shadow of the sword sweeter is the melodious sounding of the sword than the melodious sound of the golden pipes that accompany music in the palace  then quoth ingcel i said gazing at him:  i see a high stately prince etc  i see a famous king etc  i see his white princes diadem etc  i see his two bluebright cheeks etc  i see his high wheel    round his head    which is over his yellow  curly hair  i see his mantle red manycoloured etc  i see therein a huge brooch of gold etc  i see his beautiful linen frock    from ankle to kneecaps  i see his sword goldenhilted inlaid in its scabbard of white silver etc  i see his shield bright chalky etc  a tower of inlaid gold etc  now the tender warrior was asleep with his feet in the lap of one of the two men and his head in the lap of the other then he awoke out of his sleep and arose and chanted this lay:  the howl of ossar conaires dog    cry of warriors on the summit of tol geisse a cold wind over edges perilous: a night to destroy a king is this night  he slept again and awoke thereout and sang this rhetoric:  the howl of ossar    a battle he announced: enslavement of a people: sack of the hostel: mournful are the champions: men wounded: wind of terror: hurling of javelins: trouble of unfair fight: wreck of houses: tara waste: a foreign heritage: like is lamenting conaire: destruction of corn: feast of arms: cry of screams: destruction of erins king: chariots atottering: oppression of the king of tara: lamentations will overcome laughter: ossars howl  he said the third time:  trouble hath been shewn to me: a multitude of elves: a host supine foes prostration: a conflict of men on the dodder: oppression of taras king: in youth he was destroyed: lamentations will overcome laughter: ossars howl     footnote : a small river near dublin which is said to have passed through the bruden  w s  liken thou o fer rogain him who has sung that lay  easy for me to liken him says fer rogain no conflict without a king this he is the most splendid and noble and beautiful and mighty king that has come into the whole world he is the mildest and gentlest and most perfect king that has come to it even conaire son of eterscel tis he that is overking of all erin there is no defect in that man whether in form or shape or vesture: whether in size or fitness or proportion whether in eye or hair of brightness whether in wisdom or skill or eloquence whether in weapon or dress or appearance whether in splendour or abundance or dignity whether in knowledge or valour or kindred  great is the tenderness of the sleepy simple man till he has chanced on a deed of valour but if his fury and his courage be awakened when the champions of erin and alba are at him in the house the destruction will not be wrought so long as he is therein six hundred will fall by conaire before he shall attain his arms and seven hundred will fall by him in his first conflict after attaining his arms i swear to god what my tribe swears unless drink be taken from him though there be no one else in the house but he alone he would hold the hostel until help would reach it which the man would prepare for him from the wave of clidna and the wave of assaroe while ye are at the hostel  footnote : in the bay of glandore co cork  w s  footnote : at ballyshannon co donegal  w s  nine doors there

come upon you out of the house as numerous as hailstones and grass on a green will be your halves of heads and your cloven skulls and your bones under the edge of his sword  tis my opinion that he will not chance to get out of the house dear to him are the two that are with him in the room his two fosterers dris and snithe thrice fifty warriors will fall before each of them in front of the hostel and not farther than a foot from him on this side and that will they too fall  woe to him who shall wreak the destruction were it only because of that pair and the prince that is between them

for me for i shall be the first to be slain at the hostel  alas for me says ingcel peradventure i shall be the frailest corpse etc  and whom sawest thou afterwards  the room of the rearguards  there i saw twelve men on silvery hurdles all around that room of the king light yellow hair was on them blue kilts they wore equally beautiful were they equally hardy equally shapely an ivoryhilted sword in each mans hand and they cast them not down but it is the horserods in their hands that are all round the room liken thou that o fer rogain  easy for me to say the king of taras guardsmen are there these are their names: three londs of liffey plain: three arts of ath cliath dublin: three buders of buagnech: and three trenfers of cuilne i swear what my tribe swears that many will be the dead by them around the hostel  and they will escape from it although they are wounded woe to him who shall wreak the destruction were it only because of that band and afterwards whom sawest thou there  le fri flaith son of conaire whose likeness this is  there i beheld a redfreckled boy in a purple cloak he is always a wailing in the house a stead wherein is the king of a cantred whom each man takes from bosom to bosom  so he is with a blue silvery chair under his seat in the midst of the house and he always awailing truly then sad are his household listening to him three heads of hair on that boy and these are the three green hair and purple hair and allgolden hair i know not whether they are many appearances which the hair receives or whether they are three kinds of hair which are naturally upon him but i know that evil is the thing he dreads to night i beheld thrice fifty boys on silvern chairs around him and there were fifteen bulrushes in the hand of that redfreckled boy with a thorn at the end of each of the rushes and we were fifteen men and our fifteen right eyes were blinded by him and he blinded one of the seven pupils which was in my head saith ingcel hast thou his like o fer rogain  easy for me to liken him fer rogain wept till he shed his tears of blood over his cheeks alas for him quoth he this child is a scion of contention for the men of erin with the

conaire son of eterscel le fri flaith is his name seven years there are in his age it seems to me very likely that he is miserable because of the many appearances on his hair and the various hues that the hair assumes upon him this is his special household the thrice fifty lads that are around him  woe says lomna to him that shall wreak the destruction were it only because of that boy  ye cannot says ingcel clouds of weakness are coming on you etc and after that whom sawest thou there  the room of the cupbearers  there i saw six men in front of the same room fair yellow manes upon them: green mantles about them: tin brooches at the opening of their mantles halfhorses centaurs are they like conall cernach each of them throws his mantle round another and is as swift as a millwheel thine eye can hardly follow them liken thou those o fer rogain  this is easy for me those are the king of taras six cupbearers namely uan and broen and banna delt and drucht and dathen that feat does not hinder them from their skinking and it blunts not their intelligence thereat good are the warriors that are there thrice their number will fall by them they will share prowess with any six in the hostel and they will escape from their foes for they are out of the elfmounds they are the best cupbearers in erin woe to him that shall wreak the destruction were it only because of them  ye cannot says ingcel clouds etc and after that whom sawest thou there  the room of tulchinne the juggler  there i beheld a great champion in front of the same room on the floor of the house the shame of baldness is on him white as mountain cotton grass is each hair that grows through his head earrings of gold around his ears a mantle speckled coloured he wore nine swords in his hand and nine silvern shields and nine apples of gold he throws each of them upwards and none of them falls on the ground and there is only one of them on his palm each of them rising and falling past another is just like the movement to and fro of bees on a day of beauty when he was swiftest i beheld him at the feat and as i looked they uttered a cry about him and they were all on the housefloor then the prince who is in the house said to the juggler: we have come together since thou wast a little boy and till tonight thy juggling never failed thee  alas alas fair master conaire good cause have i a keen angry eye looked at me: a man with the third of a pupil which sees the going of the nine bands not much to him is that keen wrathful sight battles are fought with it saith he it should be known till doomsday that there is evil in front of the hostel  then he took the swords in his hand and the silvern shields and the apples of gold and again they uttered a cry and were all on the floor of the house that amazed him and he gave over his play and said:  o fer caille arise do not    its slaughter sacrifice thy pig find out who is in front of the house to injure the men of the hostel  there said he are fer cualngi fer

shields above them three red spears in their hands three red horses in their bridles in front of the hostel liken thou that o fer rogain  easily done three champions who wrought falsehood in the

says lomna  ye cannot quoth ingcel and after that whom sawest thou there  the room of the three sons of baithis of britain  there i beheld a room with three enneads in it fair yellow manes upon them and they are equally beautiful each of them wore a black cape and there was a white hood on each mantle a red tuft on each hood and an iron brooch at the opening of every mantle and under each mans cloak a huge black sword and the swords would split a hair on water they bore shields with scalloped edges liken thou them o fer rogain  easily done that is the robberband of the three sons of baithis of britain three enneads will fall by them in their first conflict and among them they will share a mans triumph and after that whom sawest thou  the room of the mimes  there i beheld a trio of jesters hard by the fire three dun mantles they wore if the men of erin were in one place even though the corpse of his mother or his father were in front of each not one could refrain from laughing at them wheresoever the king of a cantred is in the house not one of them attains his seat on his bed because of that trio of jesters whenever the kings eye visits them it smiles at every glance liken thou that o fer rogain  easily done mael and mlithe and admlithe  those are the king of erins three jesters by each of them a man will perish and among them they will share a mans triumph  woe to him

a cup of water in front of each man and on each cup a bunch of watercress liken thou that o fer rogain  easily done black and dun and dark: they are the king of taras three cupbearers to wit the sons of day and night and after that whom sawest thou there  the room of nar the squinterwiththelefteye  there i beheld a oneeyed man asquint with a ruinous eye a swines head he had on the fire continually squealing liken thou that o fer rogain  easy for me to name the like he is nar the squinter with the left eye the swineherd of bodb of the elfmound on femen tis he that is over the cooking blood hath been split at every feast at which he has ever been present  rise up then ye champions says ingcel and get you on to the house  with that the reavers march to the hostel and made a murmur about it  silence a while says conaire what is this  champions at the house says conall cernach  there are warriors for them here answers conaire  they will be needed tonight conall cernach rejoins  then went lomna druth before the host of reavers into the hostel the doorkeepers struck off his head then the head was thrice flung into the hostel and thrice cast out of it as he himself had foretold  then conaire himself sallies out of the hostel together with some of his people and they fight a combat with the host of reavers and six hundred fell by conaire before he could get to his arms then the hostel is thrice set on fire and thrice put out from thence: and it was granted that the destruction would never have been wrought had not work of weapons been taken from conaire  thereafter conaire went to seek his arms and he dons his battledress and falls to plying his weapons on the reavers together with the band that he had then after getting his arms six hundred fell by him in his first encounter  after this the reavers were routed i have told you says fer rogain son of donn desa that if the champions of the men of erin and alba attack conaire at the house the destruction will not be wrought unless conaires fury and valour be quelled  short will his time be say the wizards along with the reavers this was the quelling they brought a scantness of drink that seized him  thereafter conaire entered the house and asked for a drink  a drink to me o master mac cecht says conaire  says mac cecht: this is not the order that i have hitherto had from thee to give thee a drink there are spencers and cupbearers who bring drink to thee the order i have hitherto had from thee is to protect thee when the champions of the men of erin and alba may be attacking thee around the hostel thou wilt go safe from them and no spear shall enter thy body ask a drink of thy spencers and thy cupbearers  then conaire asked a drink of his spencers and his cupbearers who were in the house  in the first place there is none they say all the liquids that had been in the house have been spilt on the fires  the cupbears found no drink for him in the dodder a river and the dodder had flowed through the house  then conaire again asked for a drink a drink to me o fosterer o mac cecht tis equal to me what death i shall go to for anyhow i shall perish  then mac cecht gave a choice to the champions of valour of the men of erin who were in the house whether they cared to protect the king or to seek a drink for him  conall cernach answered this in the house  and cruel he deemed the contention and afterwards he had always a feud with mac cecht  leave the defense of the king to us says conall and go thou to seek the drink for of thee it is demanded  so then mac cecht fared forth to seek the drink and he took conaires son le fri flaith under his armpit and conaires golden cup in which an ox with a baconpig would be boiled and he bore his shield and his two spears and his sword and he carried the caldronspit a spit of iron  he burst forth upon them and in front of the hostel he dealt nine blows of the iron spit and at every blow nine reavers fell then he makes a sloping feat of the shield and an edgefeat of the sword about his head and he delivered a hostile attack upon them six hundred fell in his first encounter and after cutting down hundreds he goes through the band outside  the doings of the folk of the hostel this is what is here examined presently  conall cernach arises and takes his weapons and wends over the door of the hostel and goes round the house three hundred fell by him and he hurls back the reavers over three ridges out from the hostel and boasts of triumph over a king and returns wounded into the hostel  cormac condlongas sallies out and his nine comrades with him and they deliver their onsets on the reavers nine enneads fall by cormac and nine enneads by his people and a man for each weapon and a man for each man and cormac boasts of the death of a chief of the reavers they succeed in escaping though they be wounded  the trio of picts sally forth from the hostel and take to plying their weapons on the reavers and nine enneads fall by them and they chance to escape though they be wounded  the nine pipers sally forth and dash their warlike work on the reavers and then they succeed in escaping  howbeit then but it is long to relate tis weariness of mind tis confusion of the senses tis tediousness to hearers tis superfluity of narration to go over the same things twice but the folk of the hostel came forth in order and fought their combats with the reavers and fell by them as fer rogain and lomna druth had said to ingcel to wit that the folk of every room would sally forth still and deliver their combat and after that escape so that none were left in the hostel in conaires company save conall and sencha and dubthach  now from the vehement ardour and the greatness of the contest which conaire had fought his great drouth of thirst attacked him and he perished of a consuming fever for he got not his drink so when the king died those three sally out of the hostel and deliver a wily stroke of reaving on the reavers and fare forth from the hostel wounded to broken and maimed  touching mac cecht however he went his way till he reached the well of casair which was near him in crich cualann but of water he found not therein the full of his cup that is conaires golden cup which he had brought in his hand before morning he had gone round the chief rivers of erin to wit bush boyne bann barrow neim luae laigdae shannon suir sligo samair find ruirthech slaney and in them he found not the full of his cup of water  then before morning he had travelled to the chief lakes of erin to wit lough derg loch luimnig lough foyle lough mask lough corrib loch laig loch cuan lough neagh morloch and of water he found not therein the full of his cup  he went his way till he reached uaran garad on magh ai it could not hide itself from him: so he brought thereout the full of his cup and the boy fell under his covering  after this he went on and reached da dergas hostel before morning  when mac cecht went across the third ridge towards the house tis there were twain striking off conaires head the mac cecht strikes off the head of one of the two men who were beheading conaire the other man then was fleeing forth with the kings head a pillarstone chanced to be under mac cechts feet on the floor of the hostel he hurls it at the man who had conaires head and drove it through his spine so that his back broke after this mac cecht beheads him mac cecht then split the cup of water into conaires gullet and neck then said conaires head after the water had been put into its neck and gullet:  a good man mac cecht an excellent man mac cecht a good warrior without good within he gives a drink he saves a king he doth a deed well he ended the champions i found he sent a flagstone on the warriors well he hewed by the door of the hostel  fer le so that a spear is against one hip good should i be to farrenowned mac cecht if i were alive a good man  after this mac cecht followed the routed foe  tis this that some books relate that but a very few fell around conaire namely nine only and hardly a fugitive escaped to tell the tidings to the champions who had been at the house  where there had been five thousand  and in every thousand ten hundred only one set of five escaped namely ingcel and his two brothers echell and tulchinne the yearling of the reavers  three great grandsons of conmac and the two reds of roiriu who had been the first to wound conaire  thereafter ingcel went into alba and received the kingship after his father since he had taken home triumph over a king of another country  this however is the recension in other books and it is more probably truer of the folk of the hostel forty or fifty fell and of the reavers three fourths and one fourth of them only escaped from the destruction  now when mac cecht was lying wounded on the battlefield at the end of the third day he saw a woman passing by  come hither o woman says mac cecht  i dare not go thus says the woman for horror and fear of thee  there was a time when i had this o woman even horror and fear of me on some one but now thou shouldst fear nothing i accept thee on the truth of my honour and my safeguard  then the woman goes to him  i know not says he whether it is a fly or a gnat or an ant that nips me in the wound  it happened that it was a hairy wolf that was there as far as its two shoulders in the wound  the woman seized it by the tail and dragged it out of the wound and it takes the full of its jaws out of him  truly says the woman this is an ant of ancient land  says mac cecht i swear to god what my people swears i deemed it no bigger than a fly or a gnat or an ant  and mac cecht took the wolf by the throat and struck it a blow on the forehead and killed it with a single blow  then le fri flaith son of conaire died under mac cechts armpit for the warriors heat and sweat had dissolved him  thereafter mac cecht having cleansed the slaughter at the end of the third day set forth and he dragged conaire with him on his back and buried him at tara as some say then mac cecht departed into connaught to his own country that he might work his cure in mag brengair wherefore the name clave to the plain from mac cechts misery that is mag brenguir  now conall cernach escaped from the hostel and thrice fifty spears had gone through the arm which upheld his shield he fared forth till he reached his fathers house with half his shield in his hand and his sword and the fragments of his two spears then he found his father before his garth in taltiu  swift are the wolves that have hunted thee my son saith his father  tis this that has wounded us thou old hero an evil conflict with warriors conall cernach replied  hast thou then news of da dergas hostel asked amorgin is thy lord alive  he is not alive says conall  i swear to god what the great tribes of ulaid swear it is cowardly for the man who went thereout alive having left his lord with his foes in death  my wounds are not white thou old hero says conall  he shews him his shieldarm whereon were thrice fifty wounds: this is what was inflicted upon it the shield that guarded it is what saved it but the right arm had been played upon as far as two thirds thereof since the shield had not been guarding it that arm was mangled and maimed and wounded and pierced save that the sinews kept it to the body without separation  that arm fought tonight may son says amorgein  true is that thou old hero says conall cernach many there are unto whom it gave drinks of death tonight in front of the hostel  now as to the reavers every one of them that escaped from the hostel went to the cairn which they had built on the night before last and they brought thereout a stone for each man not mortally wounded so this is what they lost by death at the hostel a man for every stone that is now in carn lecca  it endeth: amen: it endeth
