as regards conachar : on the morrows morn cathbad  and genann of the bright cheek with the other  magicians were brought before him  forgall monachs  daughter emer as well and celtchar mac uitechairs  daughter niamh and all the womankind and woman  folk of whoni conachar sought to know what ward  that day they would keep over cuchullin  we know  not answered all conachar said  i know : take him  this day into glenn tia mbodhar ie the glen of the  deaf so called for the reason that were all erins men  round about it and loudly uttering their cries of war  yet might none in that glen hear either shout or halloo   thither then to take cuchullin is your duty  there  let him this day be well and prudently and cunningly  and craftily kept by you until the spell be spent and  to his succour conall come out of pictland   monarch  said niamh  albeit for the fair days length we inter  ceded with him and besought him yet not for me nor   for the women all yielded he yesterday to enter that  same glen let cathbad go to him  and genann  the  poets and the women and thyself with emer lead  him into that glen there make for him festival and  pleasure with diverse artifice distracting him  so shall  he not to his great perturbation hear calatins children  with their shouts and cries provocative  i indeed  will not go with him said emer   rather let niamh  with our blessing go for she it is whom to refuse most  irks him this now being so resolved among them  together come women and maids wise men and poets  reciters and all various professors that were in the fort  and into the house where cuchullin was they entered  cathbad also with conachars harper and fosterbrother  cobhtach of the sweet strains making melody and  music  ferchertne too being on the couch beside  cuchullin guarding and beguiling him then cathbad  standing over against him fell to beseech him and to  intercede with him and niamh going to him upon the  couch gave him three kisses fondly lovingly  dear  son pleaded cathbad  come with me this day to share  my banquet and with us will come all the women and  the poets and verily to shun or to decline a feast  also is ges to thee  alas for that cuchullin cried    now is it no becoming time for me to feast and to  make merry : while erins four great quarters burn and  destroy the province while ulster are in the pains and  con all in foreign parts  so that the men of erin  reviling me the while and reproaching me say that i  am put to flight but were it not thou and conachar  genann and ferchertne the women and the bards as  well upon the men i would fall and sternly execute a  scattering of enemies so that their dead should be    more than their living then emer and all the women  pleaded with him and the queen  addressed herself to  him saying :  little cu never until this hour have i  hindered thee of exploit or of expedition that thou  mightst desire for my sake then o my first love  and first darling of the earths men my only chosen  sweetheart thou one favourite of erins poets go  now with cathbad and with genann with celtchars  daughter niamh and all the poets to share the feast  which for thee cathbad hath prepared discreetly  and with sweet syllables niamh too intreated him  and they all rising he sorrowful and heavy bore them  company and so entered into glenn na mbodhar   alas for this cuchullin said   i have ever shunned  entering into this glen nor ever have come into a spot  that more misliked me  for the men of erin will say  that to escape from them i now am here into the  regal mansion of vast size by cathbad fashioned to  receive cuchullin now they repaired  in the midst of  the glen liaih macha and the dubhsaighlenn  were  unyoked at the kings side of the mansion sat  cuchullin upon whose one hand were cathbad genann  and the poets  upon the other niamh daughter of  celtchar with the women opposite were the musicians  and the reciters performing for them thus with  melody and play they betook them to drink and to be  merry making brave and wondrous show of joy and  joviality before him there so far their doings   of calatins children we now will tell expressly   his three maimed misshapen daughters lightly flutter  ing swiftly swooping gained emanias green and  sought the spot where the day before they had descried  cuchullin whom when they found not without avail  they searched out all emania then marvelled whither  he might be gone he not being with conachar and  with his heroes of the red hall straightway these  apparitions knew that from them cathbads powers  concealed him up then they rose birdlike airily  soaring with the moaning magic wind of their own  making and vehemently borne away to scrutinise  the entire province  so that nor wood nor sloping  glen nor dark recess nor path impracticable they left  unsearched until at length they came over glenn na  mbodhar and in midglen saw the hath macha and  dubhsaighlenn with riangabars son laegh that  tended them then they were aware that cuchullin  must be in the glen  and they heard the poets noise  and music as joyously they banqueted with resonant  mirth of womankind and womanfolk and maidens  seeking to cheer cuchullins heart and soul calatins  offspring therefore gathering hooded sharpspiked  thistles the light wee puffballs and the woods withered  fluttering leaves made of them phantasms of numerous  warriors armourclad and of fightingmen bearing  battleweapons so that around the glen was no hill nor  hillock nor whole district but was filled with battalions  with companies of an hundred and with marshalled  bands up to the clouds of heaven and to the vault   f the firmament ascended the cries loud and wailing  :he hoarse bellowings the hideous chattering laughter  vhich these uttered round the glen also the land  vas full of preyings of burnings of womens tears and  amentation of goblins and all eldritch things that  ibbered of trumpets and of horns that brayed by  vhich great prodigies of calatins descendants both  nen and women both hounds and all other dogs  hroughout all the region were terrorstricken but  ahen the women in the glen heard these continued  :ries they answering shouted back  yet had cuchullin  and more readily than they caught the great uproars  sound  alas   he said  loud cries i hear from the  men of erin that harry all the province  now is my  triumphs end at hand no more shall i be as of old  esteemed ulster lies low for ever    let that pass  cathbad said  these be but idle and fairy noises of  fleeting motley hosts by calatins children framed with  design to hurt thee heed them not but bide here yet   while  banquet with us and be merry thus did cu  :hullin but still they heard the din of calatins children  raised about the glen  answering which the women  then would cry aloud and raise debate and join in  sports around cuchullin calatins children perceiving  hat against cathbads cunning and the womankind  these spells of theirs availed them nought they wearied  in the end  here stay ye calatins daughter badb   said to her two sisters  and maintain the fight that i  may enter into the glen and though my death come of  it accost cuchullin then she going forth careered    shamelessly and madly to the palace where she  assumed a womans form of the women of celtchars  daughter niamh and beckoned out the queen to speak  with her out through the palacedoor a great com  pany of the women being with her niamh came then   whom every one the witch by her power and magic  wiles led far from the mansion and having confounded  and confused them quite sent them wandering through  the glen then betwixt them and the palace behind  them cast a spell this done she departed as knowing  that from cuchullin niamh had exacted troth that  until she should license him he would not fall on the  men of erin now then she took on her niamhs shape  and being come where cuchullin was bade him attack  the hosts saying :  my soul my hero and my warrior   dun delgan is burnt the plain of conaille muirthemnes  plain and the whole province ravaged  all which  ulster will lay to my charge for that in place of letting  thee out to avenge the preys and to check this army  i een have hindered and withheld thee further i  know that i must die  and that surely tis conachar  shall slay me who suffered thee not to avenge the   province then she pronounced a lay   cuchullin said :  alas after that tis hard to trust in  woman  i thought that for all gold of the globe and  for the whole worlds wealth never wouldst thou have  granted me this leave yet since tis thou that sufferest  me to affront battle and dire combat with all erins  men verily i will go to it thereupon cuchullin  being thus enjoined rose presently but heavy with  grief and as he raised himself to stand upright his  mantles border chanced under his feet or to be special  under his left foot so that he unwittingly was put    sitting he from that misadventure upspringing rose  again red for shame and the gold bodkin in his mantle  flew up to the palace rooftree then downwards falling  pierced his foot through to the earth true said  cuchullin the bodkin is a foe the cloak a friend it  warns me he came out of the palace and bade  laegh mac riangabra harness the horses and make  ready the chariot cathbad and genann and the  womenfolk in general following him put forth their  hands to lay hold on him but might not stay or stop  him of going from the glen then they gazed on the  province as it lay stretched before them on all sides  the witch now being departed from them loudly and  terribly they raised the same cries as before  which  when cuchullin heard much that he never yet had  seen was shown him then was he certified that his  gessa were destroyed and his endowments perished  but cathbad sought to quiet him saying  dear son for  this day only abide by niy counsel : which is that thou  assail not the men of erin and thenceforth from all  magic of calatins children i will save thee dear  master he answered henceforth there is no more  cause to guard my life : my span is ended my gessa  done away with and niamh hath licensed me to go  meet the men of erin next niamh overtook him  and  alas my little cu she cried  not for the globes  gold not for the whole worlds wealth had i eer given  thee that leave  neither was it i that licensed thee but  calatins daughter badb in my shape taken upon her  to deceive thee abide with me then my friend my  gentle loving darling   but he believing nought of  that which she said commanded laegh to harness the  horses to prepare the chariot and to set his fighting  gear in order laegh went about the task nor ever at  any time had been more loath than now he was to  execute the same as he was wont to do so now he  shook the bridles at the horses but they fled before  him  the hath macha evading him and shewing him  obstinacy with restiveness ah true it is said laegh    to me tis presage of great evil o my soul ie the  liatjt seldom indeed before this day would ye not  come to meet the bridle and to meet myself and he  proceeded to discourse the hath macha inditing of  his merits and of his fame and saying to him :       yet even so the horse stayed not for laegh who  coming to cuchullin told him that the hath macha  stayed not for him cuchullin himself rose to catch  him but neither for him stayed he  while down the  hath machas cheeks coursed tears of dusky blood  large as clenched fist of warrior laegh coming on the  horses other side said :  this day hath macha above  any former day tis urgent on thee to prove that thou  art good and he pronounced a lay   then the hath macha stood for laegh  the dubh  saighlenn also he harnessed and on them both imposed  the chariot  which done he fell to set in order and  array cuchullins varied implements and edged weapons  about his skin cuchullin took his battlesuit and all  leavetaking omitted leaped into his chariot  but from  their appointed places when they were set ready to his  hand his weapons in the chariot fell away from him  and down beneath his feet : to him a mighty fore  shadowing of evil he set his face the way he had to  go and reached emania  nor far had they progressed  when it seemed to him that on emanias green stood  strong battalions the plain he saw as it were filled with     great ranks and troops of battle with companies of an  hundred and marshalled lines with horses arms and  armour in great plenty he deemed moreover that he  heard shouts more and more terribly increase saw  burnings throughout the city spread and extend whilst  around emania nor hill nor hillock but was full of  plunderers it appeared to him that men slew emer  and out over emanias rampart tossed her  that the  red hall was all aglow and emania as it had been  a firebrand blazing in murky black and crimsonflecked  vapour of great smoke  cathbad he said  alas for  this  though ye would hinder me and stay me how  great are these preyings these burnings and incursions  throughout the plain of emanias level land and over  the whole province   cathbad answering said  dear  son these be but great delusions : temptations which  these shadowy hosts feeble and empty these vague  and misty crowds all magicbegotten bring to bear  upon thee  for saving only grass and leaves nought  else is there but of all this from cathbad he believed  nothing rather saying :   cathbad son of maelcrch from cam maighe      in the meantime the womenfolk weeping before  them and behind them wailing they came to emania  and he sought the bower where emer lay  who  coming forth to meet them bade him alight and enter  cuchullin answered :  i will not until i shall have  gone to muirthemne : there to attack erins four  great provinces and to avenge the preys the evils  and the wrongs by them inflicted on me and on  ulster generally  for it hath been shown me that  this place was filled with hostings and with gather     ings of the men of erin burning it up and scorching  it  verily the young woman said  these are all but  magic phantasms  heed them not nor regard them   girl said cuchullin  my word i pledge thee that  until i shall assault the men of erins camp from  this my task i never will hold back at this hearing  the womankind raised piercing cries of lamentation   but of the queen and of them all he took his leave  then cathbad and the poets with loving zeal attend  ing him went on to dechtires dun there to bid his  mother farewell dechtire when he came upon the  green stepped forth to meet him the while knowing  well that it was to fall upon the men of erin he was  fain to go then she proffered him that vat from  which to take a draught before journey or expedition  undertaken was to him a certitude of victory  but this  time what should be in the great vessel but crimson  blood alone  dechtire alas   he said  that all else  forsake me surely is no wonder when in this state thou  tenderest me the vat a second time she took and  filled it then gave it to him  and a second time it was  full of blood thrice she filled up the vat and each  time it was full of blood anger against the vat seized  on cuchullin now whereby he hurling it against a rock  shattered it  hence to this day tulach an bhalldin   hill of the vat is that hills name  lady tis true  and as regards myself thou art not in fault  but tis  my essa that are all destroyed and that my lifes end  is near: from the men of erin this time i shall not  return alive then he said this lay :    o dechtire thy vat is empty     dechtire and cathbad now besought him that he     would refrain and await conall  but he said  by no  means will i wait for my span and my triumphs are  determined  yet will i not for the worlds lying vanities  forsake my fame and battlevirtues seeing that from  the day when first i took a fullgrown warriors  weapons in my hand i never have shirked fight or fray  now therefore still less will i do so for fame will  outlive life again he was on emanias green where  ulsters chiefs and chieftains daughters dolefully  waiting for him raised piteous cries of grief last of  all cathbad alone followed him  nor as yet were they  a great way from the fort when at the entrance into  the ford of washing on emanias plain they chanced  upon a maiden slender and white of her body yellow  of her hair in grief and tribulation she on the fords  extreme brink ever washed and wrung crimson bloody  spoils  little cu cathbad asked  seest thou not  yonder sight she is badbs daughter that with woe  and mourning washes thy gear because she signifies  thy fall and thy destruction by meaves great hosting  and by incantations of calatins children hence it  is my gentle fosterson that thou shouldst refrain  but :  dear guardian it is well he answered   follow  me now no farther for from avenging on the men of  erin this their coming to burn up my country to  ravage and to consume my stronghold i may not stay  what though the fairy woman wash my spoils  great     spoil of arms of armour and of gear is that which by  my sword and by my spear shall shortly lie there  drenched in blood in streams and pools of curdled  gore moreover loath as ye be to dismiss me into  danger and against my foes there to encounter death  and dissolution even so cheerful am i that now go to  have my side bored and my body mangled  neither  knowest thou better than i myself know that in this  onset i must fall no more then hinder my path and  course  for whether i stay i am devoted to death or  whether i go my lifes span is run out from me to  ulster to conachar also and to emer carry life and  health  to meet whom no more for ever i shall go  pity that we should part  a sad and a lamentable  rending is our rending away from you  for as now  in gloom and grief o laegh we get us gone from  emer even so out of far countries and from foreign  tribes many a day in gallant glee we came home to   her then he uttered a lay   herewith cuchullin turned his face to emania and  gazing on the town hearkened to the lamentation  made by the womankind then it seemed to him that  over rath sailenn which today is called ard macha  armagh he saw the angels in their watches   he  was aware that over the rath from heaven to earth the  space was full of splendour and of light of all things  excellent of organs music of canticles and minstrelsy  to this which he beheld he gave his mind intently and  into his heart with influence of love the melody which  he heard sank these revelations he told to cathbad  saying: these be not like the wonders which as i    would return to emania used to be shown me terrible  or hideous the one almighty god whom they that  are up there adore him i do worship and in the king  supreme that made heaven and earth i do believe  now henceforth and for evermore welcome death  and he took leave of cathbad so he turned his back  on emania and in joy and gladness cheerful and void  of care went on his way  his weariness also his  delusion and his gloom passed from him
