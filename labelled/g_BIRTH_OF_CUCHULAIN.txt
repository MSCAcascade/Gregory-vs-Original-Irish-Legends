birth of cuchulain  in the time long ago conchubar son of ness was king of ulster and he held his court in the palace of emain macha and this is the way he came to be king he was but a young lad and his father was not living and fergus son of rogh who was at that time king of ulster asked his mother ness in marriage  now ness that was at one time the quietest and kindest of the women of ireland had got to be unkind and treacherous because of an unkindness that had been done to her and she planned to get the kingdom away from fergus for her own son so she said to fergus: let conchubar hold the kingdom for a year so that his children after him may be called the children of a king and that is the marriage portion i will ask of you  you may do that the men of ulster said to him for even though conchubar gets the name of being king it is yourself that will be our king all the time so fergus agreed to it and he took ness as his wife and her son conchubar was made king in his place    but all through the year ness was working to keep the kingdom for him and she gave great presents to the chief men of ulster to get them on her side and though conchubar was but a young lad at that time he was wise in his judgments and brave in battle and good in shape and inform and they liked him well and at the end of the year when fergus asked to have the kingship back again they consulted together and it is what they agreed that conchubar was to keep it and they said: it is little fergus thinks about us when he was so ready to give up his rule over us for a year and let conchubar keep the kingship they said and let fergus keep the wife he has got  now it happened one day that conchubar was making a feast at emain macha for the marriage of his sister dechtire with sualtim son of roig and at the feast dechtire was thirsty and they gave her a cup of wine and as she was drinking it a mayfly flew into the cup and she drank it down with the wine and presently she went into her sunny parlour and her fifty maidens along with her and she fell into a deep sleep and in her sleep lugh of the long hand appeared to her and he said: it is i myself was the mayfly that came to you in the cup and it is with me you must come away now and your fifty maidens along with you and he put on them the appearance of a flock of birds and they went with him southward till they came to brugh na boinne the dwellingplace of the sidhe and no one at emain macha could get tale or tidings of them or know where they had gone or what had happened them  it was about a year after that time there was another feast in emain and conchubar and his chief men were sitting at the feast and suddenly they saw from the window a great flock of birds that lit on the ground and began to eat up everything before them so that not so much as a blade of grass was left    the men of ulster were vexed when they saw the birds destroying all before them and they yoked nine of their chariots to follow after them conchubar was in his own chariot and there were following with him fergus son of rogh and laegaire buadach the battlewinner and celthair son of uithecar and many others and bricriu of the bitter tongue was along with them  they followed after the birds across the whole country southward across slieve fuad by ath lethan by ath garach and magh gossa between fir rois and fir ardae and the birds before them always they were the most beautiful that had ever been seen nine flocks of them there were linked together two and two with a chain of silver and at the head of every flock there were two birds of different colours linked together with a chain of gold and there were three birds that flew by themselves and they all went before the chariots to the far end of the country until the fall of night and then there was no more seen of them  and when the dark night was coming on conchubar said to his people: it is best for us to unyoke the chariots now and to look for some place where we can spend the night  then fergus went forward to look for some place and what he came to was a very small poorlooking house a man and a woman were in it and when they saw him they said: bring your companions here along with you and they will be welcome fergus went back to his companions and told them what be had seen but bricriu said: where is the use of going into a house like that with neither room nor provisions nor coverings in it it is not worth our while to be going there  then bricriu went on himself to the place where the house was but when he came to it what he saw was a grand new welllighted house and at    the door there was a young man wearing armour very tall and handsome and shining and he said: come into the house bricriu why are you looking about you and there was a young woman beside him fine and noble and with curled hair and she said: surely there is a welcome before you from me why does she welcome me said bricriu it is on account of her that i myself welcome you said the young man and is there no one missing from you at emain he said there is surely said bricriu we are missing fifty young girls for the length of a year would you know them again if you saw them said the young man if i would not know them said bricriu it is because a year might make a change in them so that i would not be sure try and know them again said the man for the fifty young girls are in this house and this woman beside me is their mistress dechtire it was they themselves changed into birds that went to emain macha to bring you here then dechtire gave bricriu a purple cloak with gold fringes and be went back to find his companions but while he was going he thought to himself: conchubar would give great treasure to find these fifty young girls again and his sister along with them i will not tell him i have found them i will only say i have found a house with beautiful women in it and no more than that  when conchubar saw bricriu he asked news of him what news do you bring back with you bricriu he said i came to a fine welllighted house said bricriu i saw a queen noble kind with royal looks with curled hair i saw a troop of women beautiful welldressed i saw the man of the house tall and openhanded and shining let us go there for the night said conchubar so they brought their chariots and their horses and their arms and they were hardly in the house when every sort of food and of drink some they knew and    some they did not know was put before them so that they never spent a better night and when they had eaten and drunk and began to be satisfied conchubar said to the young man: where is the mistress of the house that she does not come to bid us welcome you cannot see her tonight said he for she is in the pains of childbirth  so they rested there that night and in the morning conchubar was the first to rise up but he saw no more of the man of the house and what he heard was the cry of a child and he went to the room it came from and there he saw dechtire and her maidens about her and a young child beside her and she bade conchubar welcome and she told him all that had happened her and that she had called him there to bring herself and the child back to emain macha and conchubar said: it is well you have done by me dechtire you gave shelter to me and to my chariots you kept the cold from my horses you gave food to me and my people and now you have given us this good gift and let our sister finchoem bring up the child he said no it is not for her to bring him up it is for me said sencha son of ailell chief judge and chief poet of ulster for i am skilled i am good in disputes i am not forgetful i speak before any one at all in the presence of the king i watch over what he says i give judgment in the quarrels of kings i am judge of the men of ulster no one has a right to dispute my claim but only conchubar  if the child is given tome to bring up said blai the distributor he will not suffer from want of care or from forgetfulness it is my messages that do the will of conchubar i call up the fighting men from all ireland i am well able to provide for them for a week or even for ten days i settle their business and their disputes i support their honour i get satisfaction for their insults    you think too much of yourself said fergus it is i that will bring up the child i am strong i have knowledge i am the kings messenger no one can stand up against me in honour or riches i am hardened to war and battles i am a good craftsman i am worthy to bring up a child i am the protector of all the unhappy the strong are afraid of me i am the helper of the weak  if you will listen to me at last now you are quiet said amergin i am able to bring up a child like a king the people praise my honour my bravery my courage my wisdom they praise my good luck my age my speaking my name my courage and my race though i am a fighter i am a poet i am worthy of the kings favour i overcome all the men who fight from their chariots i owe thanks to no one except conchubar i obey no one but the king  then sencha said: let finchoem keep the child until we come to emain and morann the judge will settle the question when we are there  so the men of ulster set out for emain finchoem having the child with her and when they came there morann gave his judgment it is for conchubar he said to help the child to a good name for he is next of kin to him let sencha teach him words and speaking let fergus hold him on his knees let amergin be his tutor and he said: this child will be praised by all by chariot drivers and fighters by kings and by wise men he shall be loved by many men he will avenge all your wrongs he will defend your fords he will fight all your battles  and so it was settled and the child was left until he should come to sensible years with his mother dechtire and with her husband sualtim and they brought him up upon the plain of muirthemne and the name he was known by was setanta son of sualtim
