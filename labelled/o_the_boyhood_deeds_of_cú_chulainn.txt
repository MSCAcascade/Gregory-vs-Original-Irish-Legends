this boy said fergus was reared in his fathers and his mothers house by the seaside northwards in the plain of muirthemne where someone gave him an account of the macrad or boycorps of emain macha how that conchobar divides his day into three parts: the first being devoted to watching the boycorps at their sport especially that of hurling the second to the playing of chess and draughts the third to pleasurable consuming of meat and drink until drowsiness sets in which then is promoted by the exertions of minstrels and musicians to induce favorable placidity of mind and disposition and for all that we are banished from him continued fergus by my word i swear that neither in ireland nor in scotland is there a warrior his ie conchobars counterpart the little lad then as aforesaid having heard of all this one day told his mother that he was sent on a visit to emain macha to test the boycorps at their own sports she objected that he was immature and ought to wait until some grown warrior or other or some confidential of conchobars should in order to insure his safety bind over the boycorps to keep the peace toward him he told his mother that that was too long an outlook that he could not wait and that all she had to do was to set him a course for emain macha since he did not know in which direction it lay  it is a weary way from here said the mother for between thee and it lies sliab fuait  give me the bearings said he and she did so  away he went then taking with him his hurly of brass his bail of silver his throwing javelin and his toy spear with which equipment he fell to shortening the way for himself he did it thus: with his hurly he would strike the ball and drive it a great distance then he pelted the hurly after it and drove it just as far again then he threw his javelin lastly the spear which done he would make a playful rush after them all pick up the hurly the ball and the javelin while before the spears tip could touch the earth he had caught the missile by the other end  in due course cu chulainn reached emain macha where he found the boycorps thrice fifty in number hurling on the green and practicing martial exercises with conchobars son follamain at their head the lad dived right in among them and took a hand in the game he got the ball between his legs and held it there not suffering it to travel higher up than his knees or lower down than his anklejoints and so making it impossible for them to get in a stroke or in any other way to touch it in this manner he brought it along and sent it home over the goal in utter amazement the whole corps looked on but follamain mac conchobar cried: good now boys all together meet this youngster as he deserves and kill him because it is taboo to have such a one join himself to you and interfere in your game without first having had the civility to procure your guarantee that his life should be respected together then and at once attack him and avenge violation of your taboo for we know that he is the son of some petty ulster warrior such as without safeconduct is not accustomed to intrude into your play  the whole of them assailed cu chulainn and simultaneously sent their hurlies at his head he however parried all the hundred and fifty and was unharmed the same with the balls which he fended off with fists forearms and palms alone their thrice fifty toy spears he received in his little shield and still was unhurt in turn now cu chulainn went among them and laid low fifty of the best: five more of them said fergus came past the spot where myself and conchobar sat at chessplay with the young lad close in their wake  hold my little fellow said conchobar i see this is no gentle game thou playest with the boycorps  and good cause i have too cried cu chulainn: after coming out of a far land to them i have not had a guests reception  how now little one said the king knowest thou not the boycorps conditions: that a newcomer must have them bound by their honor to respect his life  i knew it not said the boy otherwise i had conformed and taken measures beforehand  tis well said the king: take it now upon yourselves to let the boy go safe  we do the boycorps answered  they resumed play cu chulainn did as he would with them and again laid out fifty of them on the ground their fathers deemed they could not but be dead no such thing however it was merely that with his blows and pushes and repeated charges be so terrified them that they took to the grass  what on earth is he at with them now asked conchobar  i swear by my gods said cu chulainn that until they in their turn come under my protection and guarantee i will not lighten my hand from off them  this they did at once now said fergus in conclusion i submit that a youngster who did all this when he was just five years old needs not to excite our wonder because now being turned of seventeen years he in this cattleraid of cooley cut a fourpronged pole and the rest and that he should have killed a man or two or three men or even as indeed he has done four  conchobars son cormac conlonges spoke now saying in the year after that the same little boy did another deed  and what was that ailll asked  well continued cormac in ulster there was a good smith and artificer by name culann he prepared a banquet for conchobar and traveled to emain macha to bid him to it he begged conchobar to bring with him only a moderate number of warriors because neither land nor domain had he but merely the product of his hammer of his anvil and of his tongs conchobar promised that he would bring no more than a small company culann returned home to make his last preparations conchobar remaining in emain macha until the meeting broke up and the day came to a close then the king put on his light convenient travelling garb and betook him to the green in order to bid the boycorps farewell before he started there however he saw a curious sight one hundred and fifty youths at one end of the green and at the other a single one and he taking the goal against the crowd of them again when they played the holegame and it was their turn to aim at the bole it being his to defend it be stopped all thrice fifty balls just at the edge of the hole so that not one went in when the defense was theirs and it was his turn to shoot he would bole the entire set without missing one when the game was to tear one anothers clothes off he would have the mantles off them all while the full number could not even pull out his brooch when it was to upset each other he would knock over the hundred and fifty and they could not stretch him on the ground all which when conchobar had witnessed be said: i congratulate the land into which the little boy has come were his fullgrown deeds to prove consonant with his boyish exploits lie would indeed be of some solid use  to this doubtful expression fergus objected saying to conchobar that is not justly said for according as the little boy grows so also will his deeds increase with him  have the child called to us said the  he may come with us to share the banquet  i cannot go thither just now said the boy  how so asked conchobar  the boycorps have not yet bad enough of play  it would be too long for us to wait until they bad said the king  wait not at all i will follow after you  but young one knowest thou the way  i will follow the trail of the company of the horses and the chariots tracks  thereupon conchobar started eventually he reached culanns house was received in becoming fashion fresh rushes were laid and they fell to the banquet presently the smith said to conchobar good now o king has any one promised that this night he would follow thee to this dwelling  no not one answered conchobar quite forgetting the little boy but wherefore do you ask  it is only that i have an excellent bandog from which when his chain is taken off no one may dare to be near him for saving myself he knows not any man and in him resides the strength of an hundred  conchobar said loose him then and let him guard this place  so culann did the dog made the circuit of his country then hook up his usual position whence to watch the house and there he couched with his head on his paws surely an extraordinary cruel fierce and savage dog was he  as for the boycorps until it was time to separate they continued in emain macha then they dispersed each one to his parents house or to his nurses or to his guardians but the little fellow trusting to the trail as aforesaid struck out for culanns house with his club and his ball he shortened the way for himself as he went so soon as ever he came to the green of culanns fort the bandog became aware of him and gave tongue in such a way as to be heard throughout all the countryside not was it to carve the boy decently as for a feast that he was minded but at one gulp to swallow him down the child was without all reasonable means of defense therefore as the dog charged at him openjawed he threw his playing ball down his throat with great force which mortally punished the creatures inwards cu chulainn seized him by the hind legs and banged him against a rock to such purpose that he strewed all the ground in broken fragments  the whole company within had heard the bandogs challenge at the sound of which conchobar said tis no good luck has brought us on our present trip  your meaning asked the others  i mean that the little boy my sister dechtires son setanta mac sualtach had promised to come after me and he even now must be killed by the bandog  to a man the heroes rose and though the forts doors were thrown open out they stormed over the ramparts to seek him speedy as they were yet did fergus outstrip them he picked up the boy hoisted him on his shoulder and carried him to conchobar culann himself had come out and there he saw his bandog lie in scraps and pieces which was a hearts vexation to him he went back indoors and said thy father and thy mother are welcome both but most unwelcome thou  why what hast thou against the little fellow asked conchobar  it was no good luck that inspired me to make my feast for thee o conchobar: my dog now being gone my substance is but substance wasted my livelihood a means of living set all astray little boy he continued that was a good member of my family thou tookest from me: a safeguard of raiment of flocks and of herds  be not angered thereat said the child for in this matter myself will pronounce a just award  and what might that be inquired conchobar  the little boy replied if in all ireland there be a whelp of that dogs breed by me he shall be nurtured till he be fit for action as was his sire in the meantime i o culann myself will do thee a bandogs service in guarding of thy cattle and substance and stronghold  well hast thou made the award said conchobar and cathbad the druid chiming in declared that not in his own person could he have done it better and that henceforth the boy must bear the name cu chulainn culanns hound the youngster however objected i like my own name better: setanta mac sualtach  say not so cathbad remonstrated for all men in the world shall have their mouths full of that name  the boy answered that on those terms the name would be well pleasing to him and in this way it came to pass that it stuck to him now the little fellow continued cormac conlonges the narrator of all this who when just touching six years of age slew the dog which even a great company did not dare to approach it were not reasonable to be astonished though the same at seventeen should come to the border of the province and kill a man or two or three or four on the cattleraid of cooley  another exiled ulsterman fiacha mac firaba taking up the recital said that in the very year following that adventure of the dog the little boy had performed a third exploit  and what was that ailill asked  why it was cathbad the druid continued fiacha who to the northeast of emain macha taught his pupils there being with him eight from among the students of his art when one of them questioned him as to what purpose that day was more especially favorable cathbad told him that any stripling who on that day should for the first time assume arms and armor the name of such an one forever would surpass those of all irelands youths besides his life however must be fleeting short the boy was some distance away on the south side of emain macha nevertheless he heard cathbads speech he put off his playing suit and laid aside his implements of sport then he entered conchobars sleeping house and said all good be thine o king  conchobar answered little boy what is thy request  i desire to take arms  and who prompted thee to that  cathbad the druid answered the boy  thou shalt not be denied said the king and forthwith gave him two spears with sword and shield the boy suppled and brandished the weapons and in the process broke them all to shivers and splinters in short whereas in emain macha conchobar had seventeen weaponequipments ready for the boycorps service  since whenever one of them took arms conchobar it was who invested him with the outfit and brought him luck in the using of it  the boy made fragments of them all which done he said o my master o conchobar these arms are not good they suffice me not thereupon the king gave him his own two spears his own sword and his own shield in every possible way the boy tested them he even bent them point to hilt and head to butt yet never broke them: they endured him these arms are good said he and worthy of me fair fall the land and the region which for its king has him whose arms and armor are these  just then it was that cathbad the druid came into the house and wondering asked is the little boy assuming arms  ay indeed said the king  it is not his mothers son we would care to see assume them on this day said the druid  how now said the king was it not thyself that prompted him  not i of a surety  brat cried the king what meanest thou by telling me that it was so wherein thou hast lied to me  o king be not wroth the boy pleaded for he it was that prompted me when he instructed his other pupils for when they asked him what special virtue lay in this day he told them that the name of whatsoever youth should therein for the first time take arms would top the fame of all other erins men nor thereby should he suffer resulting disadvantage save that his life must be fleeting short  and it is true for me said cathbad noble and famous indeed thou shalt be but transitory soon gone  little care i said cu chulainn nor though i were hut one day or one night in being so long as after me the history of myself and doings may endure  then said cathbad again well then get into a chariot boy and proceed to test in thine own person whether mine utterance be truth  so cu chulainn mounted a chariot in divers ways he tried its strength and reduced it to fragments he mounted a second with the same result in brief whereas in emain macha for the boycorps service conchobar had seventeen chariots in like wise the little fellow smashed them all then he said these chariots of thine o conchobar are no good at all nor worthy of me  where is iubar mac riangabra cried conchobar  here i am he answered  prepare my own chariot and harness my own horses for him there  the driver did his will cu chulainn mounted tested the chariot and it endured him this chariot is good he said and my worthy match  good now little boy said iubar let the horses be turned out to grass  too early for that yet iubar drive on and round emain macha  let the horses go out to graze  too early yet iubar drive ahead that the boycorps may give me salutation on this the first day of my taking arms  they came to the place where the boycorps was and the cry of them resounded these are arms that thou hast taken  the very thing indeed he said  they wished him success in spoilwinning and in firstslaying but expressed regret that be was weaned away from them and their sports cu chulainn assured them that it was not so but that it was something in the nature of a charm that had caused him to take arms on this day of all others again iubar pressed him to have the horses taken out and again the boy refused he questioned the driver whither leads this great road here running by us iubar answered that it ran to ath an foraire the lookout ford in shah fuait in answer to further questions with which be plied the charioteer cu chulainn learned that the ford had that name from the fact that daily there some prime warrior of the ulstermen kept watch and ward to see that no foreign champion came to molest them it being his duty to do single combat on behalf of his whole province should poets and musicians be coming away from ulster dissatisfied with their treatment it was his duty acting for the whole province to solace them with gold and other gifts on the other hand did poets and musicians enter his province his duty was to see that they had safeconduct up to conchobars bedside this sentinels praise then would be the theme of the first pieces in divers forms of verse the poets would rehearse upon arriving in emain macha  cu chulainn inquired whether iubar knew who it was that on this particular day mounted guard i know it well the charioteer replied it is conall mac amergin surnamed cernach the victorious irelands preeminent warrior  onward to that ford then driver cried the boy  sure enough at the waters edge they came upon conall who received them with and is it arms that you have taken today little boy  it is indeed iubar answered for him  may his arms bring him triumph and victory and drawing of first blood said conall the only thing is that in my judgment thou hast prematurely assumed them seeing that as yet thou art not fit for exploits  for all answer the boy said and what dost thou here conall  on behalf of the province i keep watch and ward  come said the youngster for this day let me take the duty  never say it replied conall for as yet thou art not up to coping with a real fighting man  then will i go down to the shallows of loch echtra to see whether i may draw blood on either friend or foe  and i said conall will go to protect thee and to safeguard so that thou wilt not run into dangers on the border  nay said cu chulainn come not  i will so conall insisted for were i to permit thee all alone to frequent the border the ulstermen would avenge it on me  conall had his chariot made ready and his horses harnessed he started on his errand of protection and soon overtook cu chulainn who had cut the matter short and had gone on before they now being abreast the boy deemed that in event of opportunity to do some deed of mortal daring conall would never allow him to execute it from the ground therefore he picked up a stone about the size of his fist and took very careful aim at conalls chariotyoke he broke it in two the vehicle came down and conall was hurled prone so falling that his mouth was brought over one shoulder  whats all this boy  it was i: in order to see whether my marksmanship was good and whether there was in me the material of a good warrior  poison take both thy shot and thyself as well and though thy head should fall as a prize to some foe over yonder yet never a foot further will i budge to save thee  the very thing i crave of thee said the boy and i do this in this particular manner because to you ulstermen it is taboo to persist alter violence is done to you with that conail went back to his post at the ford  as for the little boy southwards he went his way to the shallows of loch echtra and until the days end abode there then spoke iubar: if to thee we might venture to say so much little one i should be more than rejoiced that we made instant return to emain macha for already for some time the carving has been going on there and whereas there thou hast thine am pointed place kept till thou come  between conchobars knees  i on the contrary can do nothing but join the messengers and jesters of his house to fit in where i may for which reason i judge it now fitting that i were back in time to scramble with them  cu chulainn ordered him to harness the chariot which being done they drove off and cu chulainn inquired the name of a mountain that he saw he learned that it was sliab morne and further asked the meaning of a white cairn which appeared on a summit it was finnchairn the boy thought it inviting and ordered the driver to take him thither iubar expressed great reluctance and cu chulainn said thou art a lazy loon considering that this is my first adventurequest and this is thy first trip with me  and if it is said iubar and if i ever reach emain macha for ever and for ever may it be my last  good now driver said the boy when they were on the top of the hillock in all directions point out to me the topography of ulster a country in which i know not my way about the charioteer from that position pointed out the hills and the plain lands and the strongholds of the province  tis well o driver and what now is yon welldefined glenseamed plain before us to the southward  that is the plain of bray mag breg  proceed then and instruct me concerning the strongholds and forts of that plain then iubar pointed out to him tarn and tailltiu cletty and knowth and the brug of angus mac oc on the boyne and the stronghold of nechtan sceines sons  are they those sons of nechtan of whom it is said that the number of ulstermen now alive exceeds not the number of them fallen by their hands  the same said iubar  away with us then to the stronghold of nechtans sons  woe waits on such a speech and whosoever he be that goes there i will not be the one  cu chulainn said alive or dead thither shalt thou go however  alive i go then and dead i shall be left there  they made their way to the stronghold and the little boy dismounted upon the green a green with this particular feature: in its center stood a pillar stone encircled with an iron collar test of heroic accomplishment for it bore graven writing to the effect that any man if only he were one that carried arms who should enter on this green must hold it taboo to him to depart from it without challenging to single combat some of the dwellers in the stronghold the little boy read the ogam threw his arms around the stone to start it and eventually pitched it collar and all into the water close at hand  in my poor opinion ventured iubar it is no better so than it was before and i well know that this time at all events thou wilt find the object of thy search: a prompt and violent death  good good o driver spread rue now the chariotcoverings that i may sleep a little while  alas that one should speak so for a land of foemen and not of friends is this  iubar obeyed and on the green at once the little fellow fell asleep just then it was that foill mac nechtain issued forth and at the sight of the chariot called out driver do not unharness those horses iubar made answer that he still held the reins in his hand  a sign that he was not about to unharness them  what horses are these  conchobars two piebalds  even such at sight i took them to be said foill and who has brought them into these borders  a young bit of a little boy one who for luck has taken arms today and for the purpose of showing off his form and fashion has come into the borders  never let it thrive with him said foill were it sure that he is capable of action it is dead in place of alive that he would go back to emain macha  indeed he is not capable nor could it be rightly imputed to him this is but the seventh year since his birth here the little one lifted his face from the ground not only that but his whole body to his feet blushed deep at the affront which be had overheard and said ay i am fit for action  but foil rejoined i rather would incline to hold that thou art not  thou shalt know what to hold in this matter only let us repair to the lord but first go fetch thy weapons in cowardly guise thou art come hither for nor drivers nor messengers nor folk unarmed slay i foul rushed headlong for his weapons and iubar advised the boy that be must be careful with him cu chulainn asked the reason and was told that the man was foill mac nechtain sceine invulnerable to either point or edge of any kind  not to me should such a thing be spoken he replied for i will take in hand my special feat: the tempered and refined iron ball which shall land in his foreheads midst and backwards through his skull shall carry out his brain so leaving his head traversed with a fair conduit for the air with that out came foill mac nechtain again the little lad grasped his ball hurled it with the exact effect foretold and he took foills head  out of the stronghold now the second son emerged on the green whose name was tuachall mac nechtain and he said belike thou art inclined to boast of that much cu chulainn replied that the fall of a single warrior was for him no matter of boast and tuachall told him that in that case he should not boast at all because straightway he would perish by his hand then make haste for thy weapons said the boy for in cowardly guise thou comest hither  away went tuachall iubar repeated his admonitions who is that asked the boy he was told not only that be was a son of nechtan but also that he must be slain by the first stroke or shot or other attempt of whatsoever sort or not at all and this because of the extraordinary activity and skill which in front of weapons points he displayed to avoid them again cu chulainn objected that such language ought not to be addressed to him said he i will take in my hand conchobars great spear the venomous it shall pierce the shield over his breast and after holing the heart within him shall break three ribs in his side that is the farthest from me this also the boy performed and took the victims head before his body touched the ground  now came out the youngest of the sons fainnle mac nechtain and said but simpletons they were with whom thou hast had to do cu chulainn asked him what he meant and fainnle invited him to come away down and out upon the water where his foot would not touch bottom himself on the instant darting to the ford still iubar warned the boy to be on his guard how is that then said cu chulainn  because that is fainnle mac nechtain and the reason why he bears that name is that as it were a fuinnle swallow or a weasel even so for swiftness he travels on the waters surface nor can the whole worlds swimmers attempt to cope with him  not to me ought such a thing to be said objected the boy again for thou knowest the river which we have in emain macha the callan: well when the boycorps break off from their sports and plunge into it to swim on either shoulder i take a lad of them on either palm another nor in the transit across that water ever wet as much as my ankles  then he and fainnle entered the ford and there wrestled the youngster clasped his arms around him and got him just flush with the water then he dealt him a stroke with conchobara sword and took his head letting the body go with the current to finish up cu chulainn entered the stronghold and harried it then he and iubar fired it and left it burning brightly then turned about to retrace their steps through sliab fuait not forgetting to carry with them the heads of nechtan sceines sons  soon they saw in front of them a herd of deer and the boy sought to know what were those numerous and restless cattle iubar explained that they were not cattle but a herd of wild deer that kept in the dark glens of sliab fuait he being urged to goad the horses in their direction did so but the kings fat horses could not attain to join company with the bardconditioned deer cu chulainn dismounted therefore and by sheer running and mere speed captured in the moor two stags of the greatest bulk which he made fast to the chariot with thongs still they held a course for emain macha and byandby when nearing it perceived a certain flock of whitest swans the boy asked were they pet birds or wild and learned that they were wild swans which used to congregate from rocks and islands of the sea and for feedings sake infest the country cu chulainn questioned further and wished to know which was the rarer thing: to bring some of them back to emain macha alive or to bring them dead iubar did not hesitate to say that bringing them back living would be the more creditable by far for said he you may find plenty to bring them in dead perhaps not one to bring them in living  into his sling cu chulainn laid a little stone and with it at a cast brought down eight swans of the number again he loaded this time with a larger stone and now brought down sixteen driver bring along the birds he said  but iubar hesitated i hardly can do that  and why not said the boy  because if i quit my present position the horses speed and the action being what they are the chariot wheels will cut me into pieces or else the stags antlers will pierce and otherwise wound me  no true warrior art thou iubar but come the horses i will gaze upon with such a look that they shall not break their regulation pace as for the gaze that i will bend upon the stags they will stoop their heads for awe  at this iubar ventured down and retrieved the swans which with more of the thongs and ropes he secured to the chariot in this manner they covered the rest of the way to emain macha  leborcham daughter of aed and messenger to the king perceived them now and cried a solitary chariotfighter draws near to thee now o conchobar and terribly he comes the chariot is graced with the bleeding heads of his enemies beautiful white birds he has which in the chariot bear him company and wild unbroken stags bound and tethered to the same indeed if measures be not taken to receive him prudently the best of the ulstermen must fall by his hand  i know that little chariotfighter conchobar said: the little boy my sisters son who this very day went to the border surely be will have reddened his hand and should his fury not be timely met all emain machas young men will perish by him  at last they hit upon a method to abate his manly rage the result of having shed blood and it was this: emain machas women all six score and ten in number bared their bosoms and without subterfuge of any kind trooped out to meet him their manoeuver being based on cu chulainns wellknown modesty which like all his other qualities was excessive the little fellow leaned his head against the rail of the chariot and shut them from his sight then was the desired moment all unawares he was seized and soused in a vat of cold water ready for the purpose in this first vessel the heat generated by his immersion was such that the staves and hoops flew asunder instantly in a second vat the water escaped by boiling over in yet a third the water still was hotter than one could bear by this time however the little boys fury had died down in him from crown to sole he blushed a beautiful pink red all over and they clad him in his festive clothes thus his natural form and feature were restored to him  a beautiful boy indeed was that: seven toes to each foot he had and to either hand as many lingers his eyes were bright with seven pupils apiece each one of which glittered with seven gemlike sparkles on either cheek he had four moles: a blue a crimson a green and a yellow one between one ear and the other he had fifty clearyellow long tresses that were as the yellow wax of bees or like a brooch of white gold as it glints in the sun unobscured he wore a green mantle silverclasped upon his breast a goldthread shirt the small boy took his place between conchobars knees and the king began to stroke his hair now the stripling who by the time seven years were completed since his birth bad done such deeds: had destroyed the champions by whom twothirds of the ulstermen had fallen unavenged  i hold said fiacha mac firaba the narrator that there is scant room for wonder though at seventeen he comes to the border and kills a man ay two or three or four all in the cattleraid of cooley
