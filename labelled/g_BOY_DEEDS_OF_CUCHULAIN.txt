boy deeds of cuchulain  it chanced one day when setanta was about seven years old that he heard some of the people of his mothers house talking about king conchubars court at emain macha and of the sons of kings and nobles that lived there and that spent a great part of their time at games and at hurling let me go and play with them there he said to his mother it is too soon for you to do that she said but wait till such time as you are able to travel so far and till i can put you in charge of some one going to the court that will put you under conchubars protection it would be too long for me to wait for that be said but i will go there by myself if you will tell me the road it is too far for you said dechtire for it is beyond slieve fuad emain macha is is it east or west of slieve fuad he asked and when she had answered him that be set out there and then and nothing with him but his hurling stick and his silver ball and his little dart and spear and to shorten the road for himself he would give a blow to the ball and drive it from him and then be would throw his hurling stick after it and the dart after that again and then he would make a run and catch the mall in his hand before one of them would have reached the ground  so he went on until he came to the lawn at emain    paragraph continues macha and there he saw three fifties of kings sons hurling and learning feats of war he went in among them and when the ball came near him he got it between his feet and drove it along in spite of them till he had sent it beyond the goal there was great surprise and anger on them when they saw what he had done and follaman king conchubars son that was chief among them cried out to them to come together and drive out this stranger and make an end of him for he has no right he said to come into our game without asking leave and without putting his life under our protection and you may be sure he said that he is the son of some common fighting man and it is not for him to come into our game at all with that they all made an attack on him and began to throw their hurling sticks at him and their balls and darts but he escaped them all and then be rushed at them and began to throw some of them to the ground fergus came out just then from the palace and when he saw what a good defence the little lad was making he brought him in to where conchubar was playing chess and told him all that had happened this is no gentle game you have been playing he said it is on themselves the fault is said the boy i came as a stranger and i did not get a strangers welcome you did not know then said conchubar that no one can play among the boy troop of emain unless he gets their leave and their protection i did not know that or i would have asked it of them he said what is your name and your family said conchubar my name is setanta son of sualtim and of dechtire he said when conchubar knew that he was his sisters son he gave him a great welcome and he bade the boy troop to let him go safe among them we will do that they said but when they went out to play setanta began to break through them and to overthrow them so that    they could not stand against him what are you wanting of them now said conchubar i swear by the gods my people swear by said the boy i will not lighten my hand off them till they have come under my protection the same way i have come under theirs then they all agreed to give in to this and setanta stayed in the kings house at emain macha and all the chief men of ulster had a hand in bringing him up  there was a great smith in ulster of the name of culain who made a feast at that time for conchubar and for his people when conchubar was setting out to the feast he passed by the lawn where the boy troop were at their games and he watched them awhile and he saw how the son of dechtire was winning the goal from them all that little lad will serve ulster yet said conchubar and call him to me now he said and let him come with me to the smiths feast i cannot go with you now said setanta when they had called to him for these boys have not had enough of play yet it would be too long for me to wait for you said the king there is no need for you to wait i will follow the track of the chariots said setanta  so conchubar went on to the smiths house and there was a welcome before him and fresh rushes were laid down and there were poems and songs and recitals of laws and the feast was brought in and they began to be merry and then culain said to the king: will there be any one else of your people coming after you tonight there will not said conchubar for he forgot that he had told the little lad to follow him but why do you ask me that he said i have a great fierce hound said the smith and when i take the chain off him he lets no one come into the one district with himself and he will obey no one but myself and he has in him the strength of a hundred loose him out said conchubar until he keeps a watch on    the place so culain loosed him out and the dog made a course round the whole district and then he came back to the place where he was used to lie and to watch the house and every one was in dread of him he was so fierce and so cruel and so savage  now as to the boys at emain when they were done playing every one went to his fathers house or to whoever was in charge of him but setanta set out on the track of the chariots shortening the way for himself as he was used to do with his hurling stick and his ball when he came to the lawn before the smiths house the hound heard him coming and began such a fierce yelling that he might have been heard through all ulster and he sprang at him as if he had a mind not to stop and tear him up at all but to swallow him at the one mouthful the little fellow had no weapon but his stick and his ball but when he saw the hound coming at him he struck the ball with such force that it went down his throat and through his body then he seized him by the hind legs and dashed him against a rock until there was no life left in him  when the men feasting within heard the outcry of the hound conchubar started up and said: it is no good luck brought us on this journey for that is surely my sisters son that was coming after me and that has got his death by the hound on that all the men rushed out not waiting to go through the door but over walls and barriers as they could but fergus was the first to get to where the boy was and he took him up and lifted him on his shoulder and brought him in safe and sound to conchubar and there was great joy on them all  but culain the smith went out with them and when he saw his great hound lying dead and broken there was great grief in his heart and he came in and said to setanta: there is no good welcome for you here what have you against the little lad said conchubar    paragraph continues it was no good luck that brought him here or that made me prepare this feast for yourself king he said for from this out my hound being gone my substance will be wasted and my way of living will be gone astray and little boy he said that was a good member of my family you took from me for he was the protector of my goods and my flocks and my herds and of all that i had do not be vexed on account of that said the boy and i myself will make up to you for what i have done how will you do that said conchubar this is how i will do it: if there is a whelp of the same breed to be had in ireland i will rear him and train him until he is as good a hound as the one killed and until that time culain he said i myself will be your watchdog to guard your goods and your cattle and your house you have made a fair offer said conchubar i could have given no better award myself said cathbad the druid and from this out he said your name will be cuchulain the hound of culain i am better pleased with my own name of setanta son of sualtim said the boy do not say that said cathbad for all the men in the whole world will some day have the name of cuchulain in their mouths if that is so i am content to keep it said the boy and this is how he came by the name cuchulain  it was a good while after that cathbad the druid was one day teaching the pupils in his house to the northeast of emain there were eight boys along with him that day and one of them asked him: do your signs tell of any special thing this day is good or bad for if any young man should take arms today said cathbad his name will be greater than any other name in ireland but his span of life will be short he said  cuchulain was outside at play but he heard what cathbad said and there and then he put off his playing    suit and he went straight to conchubars sleepingroom and said: all good be with you king what is it you are wanting said conchubar what i want is to take arms today who put that into your head cathbad the druid said cuchulain if that is so i will not deny you said conchubar then he gave him his choice of aims and the boy tried his strength on them and there were none that pleased him or that were strong enough for him but conchubars own so he gave him his own two spears and his sword and his shield  just then cathbad the druid came in and there was wonder on him and he said is it taking arms this young boy is he is indeed said the king it is sorry i would be to see his mothers son take arms on this day said cathbad was it not yourself bade him do it said the king i did not surely he said then you have lied to me boy said conchubar i told no lie king said cuchulain for it was he indeed put it in my mind when he was teaching the others for when one of them asked him if there was any special virtue in this day he said that whoever would for the first time take arms today his name would be greater than any other in ireland and he did not say any harm would come on him but that his life would be short and what i said is true said cathbad there will be fame on you and a great name but your lifetime will not be long it is little i would care said cuchulain if my life were to last one day and one night only so long as my name and the story of what i had done would live after me then cathbad said: well get into a chariot now and let us see if it was the truth i spoke  then cuchulain got into a chariot and tried its strength and broke it to pieces and he broke in the same way the seventeen chariots that conchubar kept for the boy troop at emain and he said: these chariots    are no use conchubar they are not worthy of me where is ibar son of riangabra said conchubar here i am he answered make ready my own chariot and yoke my own horses to it for this boy to try said conchubar so he tried the kings chariot and shook it and strained it and it bore him this is the chariot that suits me he said now little one said ibar let us take out the horses and turn them out to graze it is too early for that ibar let us drive on to where the boy troop are that they may wish me good luck on the day of my taking arms so they drove on and all the lads shouted when they saw himhave you taken arms i have indeed said cuchulain that you may do well in wounding and in first killing and in spoilwinning they said but it is a pity for us you to have left playing  let the horses go graze now said ibar it is too soon yet said cuchulain and tell me where does that great road that goes by emain lead to it leads to athanforaire the watchers ford in slieve fuad said ibar why is it called the watchers ford it is easy to tell that it is because some choice champion of the men of ulster keeps watch there every day to do battle for the province with any stranger that might come to the boundary with a challenge do you know who is in it today said cuchulain i know well it is conall cearnach the victorious the chief champion of the young men of ulster and of all ireland we will go on then to the ford said cuchulain so they went on across the plain and at the waters edge they found conall and he said: and are those arms you have taken today little boy they are indeed said ibar for him may they bring him triumph and victory and shedding of first blood said conall but i think little hound he said that you axe too ready to take them for you are not fit as yet    to do a champions work what is it you are doing here conall said the boy i am keeping watch and guard for the province rise out of it conall he said and for this one day let me keep the watch do not ask that little one said conall for you are not able yet to stand against trained fighting men then i will go down to the shallows of loch echtra and see if i can redden my arms on either friend or enemy then i will go with you myself said conall to take care of you and to protect you that no harm may happen you do not said cuchulain i will indeed said conall for if i let you go into a strange country alone all ulster would avenge it on me  so conalls horses were yoked to his chariot and he set out to follow cuchulain for he had waited for no leave but had set out by himself when cuchulain saw conall coming up with him he thought to himself if i get a chance of doing some great thing conall will never let me do it so he picked up a stone the size of his fist from the ground and made a good cast at the yoke of conalls chariot so that he broke it and the chariot came down and conall himself was thrown to the ground sideways what did you do that for he said it was to see could i throw straight and if there was the making of a good champion in me bad luck on your throwing and on yourself said conall and any one that likes may strike your head off now for i will go with you no farther that is just what i wanted said cuchulain and with that conall went back to his place at the ford  as for the lad he went on towards lough echtra in the south then ibar said: if you will listen to me little one i would like that we would go back now to emain for at this time the carving of the food is beginning there and it is all very well for you that have your place kept for you between conchubars knees    paragraph continues but as to myself he said it is among the chariotdrivers and the jesters and the messengers i am and i must find a place and fight for myself where i can what is that mountain before us said cuchulain that is slieve mourne and that is finncairn the white cairn on its top let us go to it said cuchulain we would be too long going there said ibar you are a lazy fellow said cuchulain and this my first adventure and the first journey you have made with me and that it may be my last said ibar if i ever get back to emain again they went on then to the cairn good ibar said the boy show me now all that we can see of ulster for i do not know my way about the country yet so ibar showed him from the cairn all there was to see of ulster the hills and the plains and the duns on every side what is that sloping square plain before us to the south that is magh breagh the fine meadow show me the duns and strong places of that plain so ibar showed him teamhair and tailte cleathra and cnobhach and the brugh of angus on the boyne and the dun of nechtan sceines sons are those the sons of nechtan that say in their boasting they have killed as many ulstermen as there are living in ulster today they are the same said ibar on with us then to that dun said cuchulain no good will come to you through saying that said ibar and whoever may go there i will not go he said alive or dead you must go there for all that said cuchulain then if so it is alive i will go there said ibar and it is dead i will be before i leave it  they went on then to the dun of nechtans sons and when they came to the green lawn cuchulain got out of the chariot and there was a pillarstone on the lawn and an iron collar about it and there was ogham writing on it that said no man came there and he carrying    arms should leave the place without giving a challenge to some one of the people of the dun when cuchulain had read the ogham he put his arms around the stone and threw it into the water that was there at hand i dont see it is any better there than where it was before said ibar and it is likely this time you will get what you are looking for and that is a quick death good ibar said the boy spread out the covering of the chariot now for me until i sleep for a while it is no good thing you are going to do said ibar to be going to sleep in an enemys country he put out the coverings then and cuchulain lay down and fell asleep  it was just at that time foil son of nechtan sceine came out and when he saw the chariot he called out to ibar let you not unyoke those horses i was not going to unyoke them said ibar the reins are in my hands yet what horses are they they are conchubars two speckled horses so i thought when i saw them said foill and who is it has brought them across our boundaries a young little lad said ibar that has taken arms today for luck and it is to show himself off he has come across magh breagh may he never have good luck said foil and if he were a fighting man it is not alive but dead he would go back to emain today indeed he is not able to fight or it could not be expected of him said ibar and he but a child that should be in his fathers house at that the boy lifted his head from the ground and it is red his face was and his whole body at hearing so great an insult put on him and he said: i am indeed well able to fight but foill said: i am more inclined to think you are not you will soon know what to think said the boy and let us go down now to the ford but go first and get your armour he said for i would not like to kill an unarmed    man there was anger on foill then and he went running to get his arms you must have a care now said ibar for that is foill son of nechtan and neither point of spear or edge of sword can harm him that suits me very well said the boy with that out came foil again and cuchulain stood up to him and took his iron ball in his hand and hurled it at his head and it went through the forehead and out at the back of the head and his brains along with it so that the air could pass through the hole it made and then cuchulain struck off his head  then tuachel the second son of nechtan came out on the lawn it is likely you are making a great boast of what you are doing he said i see nothing to boast of in that said cuchulain a single man to have fallen by me you will not have long to boast of it said tuachel for i myself am going to make an end of you on the moment then go back and bring your arms said cuchulain for it is only a coward would come out without arms he went back into the house then and ibar said: you must have a care now for that is tuachel son of nechtan and if he is not killed by the first stroke or the first cast or the first thrust he cannot be killed at all for there is no way of getting at him after that you need not be telling me that ibar said cuchulain for it is conchubars great spear the venomous i will take in my hand and that is the last thrust that will be made at him for after that there is no physician will heal his wounds for ever  then tuachel came out on the lawn and cuchulain took hold of the great spear and made a cast at him that went through his shield and broke three of his ribs and made a hole through his heart and then he struck his head off before the body reached the ground  then fainnle the youngest of the three sons of nechtan came out those were foolish fellows he    said to come at you the way they did but come out now after me he said into the water where your feet will not touch the bottom and with that he made a plunge into the water mind yourself well now said ibar for that is fainnle the swallow and it is why that name was put on him he travels across water with the swiftness of a swallow and there is not one of the swimmers of the whole world can come near him it is not to me you should be saying that said cuchulain for you know the river callan that runs through emain and it is what i used to do he said when the boy troop would break off from their games and plunge into the river to swim i used to take a boy of them on each shoulder and a boy on each hand and i would bring them through the river without so much as to wet my back with that he made a leap into the water where it was very deep and himself and fainnle wrestled together and then he got a grip of him and gave him a blow of conchubars sword and struck his head off and he let his body go away down the stream  then he and ibar went into the house and destroyed what was in it and they set fire to it and left it burning and turned back towards slieve fuad and they brought the heads of the three sons of nechtan along with them  presently they saw a herd of wild deer before them what sort of cattle are those said the boy they are not cattle but the wild deer of the dark places of slieve fuad make the horses go faster said cuchulain until we can see them better but with all their galloping the horses could not come up with the wild deer then cuchulain got down from the chariot and raced and ran after them until two stags lay moaning and panting from the hardness of their run through the wet bog and he bound them to the back of the chariot with the thongs of it then they went on till they came to the plain of emain and there they saw a flock of white    swans that were whiter than the swans of conchubars lake and cuchulain asked where they came from they are wild swans said ibar that are come from the rocks and the islands of the great sea to feed on the low levels of the country would it be best to take them alive or kill them it would be best to take them alive said ibar for many a one kills them and many a one makes casts at them but you would hardly find any one at all would bring them in alive with that cuchulain put a little stone in his sling and made a cast and brought down eight birds of them and then he put a bigger stone in and with it he brought down sixteen more get out now ibar he said and bring me the birds here i will no said ibar for it would not be easy to stop the horses the way they are going now and if i leap out the iron wheels of the chariot will cut through me or the horns of the stags will make a hole in me you are no good of a warrior ibar: but give me the reins and i will quiet the horses and the stags so then ibar went and brought in the swans and tied them and they alive to the chariot and the harness and it is like that they went on till they came to emain  it was levarcham daughter of aedh the conversation woman and messenger to the king that was there at that time and was sometimes away in the hills was the first to see them coming there is a chariotfighter coming conchubar she said and he is coming in anger he has the bleeding heads of his enemies with him in the chariot and wild stags are bound to it and white birds are bearing him company by the oath of my people she said if he comes on us with his anger still upon him the best men of ulster will fall by his hand i know that chariotfighter said conchubar it is the young lad son of dechtire that went over the boundaries this very day he has surely reddened his    hand and if his anger cannot be cooled the young men of emain will be in danger from him he said  then they all consulted together and it is what they agreed to send out three fifties of the women of emain rednaked to meet him when the boy saw the women coming there was shame on him and he leaned down his head into the cushions of the chariot and hid his face from them and the wildness went out of him and his feasting clothes were brought and water for washing and there was a great welcome before him  this is the story of the boy deeds of cuchulain as it was told by fergus to ailell and to maeve at the time of the war for the brown bull of cuailgne
