oengus was sleeping one night when he saw something like a maiden near him at the top of his bed she was the most beautiful woman in ireland oengus tried to take her by the hands to bring her into his bed but she suddenly vanished his mind was uneasy until the morning   the episode brought an illness upon him  this vision of a figure he had seen but with whom he hadnt spoken he did not eat any food the next night he saw her again this time with a cymbal in her hand she played a song to him so that he fell asleep he was there until morning when he woke he did not have any breakfast  a whole year passed by and she continued to visit him in his bed so that he fell in love he didnt tell anybody about this mysterious maiden he fell ill and nobody knew what was wrong with him  the physicians of erinn assembled they did not know what was wrong one went to fergne the physician of conn he came to oengus he knew from looking at oenguss face what was wrong with him he had an illness of the mind  fergne spoke with oengus and told him that an accidental love has fallen on you   my illness has judged me said oengus i loved in heartlessness and nobody dared say it to the other  it is true said oengus i met a beautiful woman the most beautiful that is in erinn with a distinguished appearance she had a cymbal in her hand on which she used to play to me every night  fergne knew that love sickness had seized oengus so he went to fetch the young mans mother boann to come and speak with him  i was trying to cure this man said fergne who has been seized by an uncertain illness  fergne asked boann to search the whole of ireland for a maiden like that which her son had seen at night and so boann searched ireland for a year but nothing was found  fergne was called for again we have not found any help in this matter said boann  fergne said: send for the dagda so that he may come and speak with his son  dagda came why have i been called here he asked to help your son said boann  your help is better for him it would be a pity for him to die he has an illness he has fallen in an accidental love and there is no help for him  what use is it to him to speak with me said the dagda my knowledge is no better than yours  fergne said to the dagda that he was the fairy king of erinn and he implored dagda to send to the fairy king of munster bodb whose knowledge was known far and wide   so they went to bodb who asked why they had come oengus the son of the dagda is in love this past two years said fergne what for said bodb he saw a maiden in his dreams we dont know anywhere in ireland that this maiden can be found bodb was asked to search ireland for a woman of this form and appearance bodb agreed and said it would take him a year until he could answer with certainty  fergne went at the end of a year back to the house of bodb at sd fer femoin   i have investigated all erinn said bodb until i found the maiden at loch bel draccon at the harp of cliach  the two went to dagda with the good news the maiden has been found said fergne now bodb insists that oengus is to come with us in order to ascertain whether he recognises her as the maiden he saw in his dreams  oengus was brought in a chariot to sd fer feimin a great feast was held with king bodb for three days and nights afterwards bodb beckoned oengus outside to see if he recognised the woman  they travelled until they were at the sea where they saw  young women and the maiden was among them a silvery chain linked every two of the women a silvery necklace around the neck and a chain of burnished gold  do you recognise the maiden bodb asked  of course i recognise her replied oengus  this is not your greatest power said bodb  not so replied oengus for i will not be able to take her with me this time  who is this maiden o bodb asked oengus  i know who she is she is caer ib ormaith daughter of ethal anbual from sid uaman in the province of connacht  oengus returned with bodb to brug mac ind oicc newgrange to visit the dagda and boann they related how they had seen the maiden and had heard the name of her father and grandfather bodb suggested to the dagda that he should go to ailell and medb in their territory in the land of connacht where the maiden was located  the dagda travelled with  chariots to connacht the king and queen welcomed him they had a feast and drank beer for a whole week the king asked dagda what was the reason for his journey  there is a maiden in your land said the dagda and my son is in love with her and an illness has seized him i came to ask if you could
