the high king of ireland  there was a king over ireland before this time whose name was eochaid feidlech and it is he was grandfather to conaire the great  he was going one time over the fair green of bri leith and he saw at the side of a well a woman with a bright comb of silver and gold and she washing in a silver basin having four golden birds on it and little bright purple stones set in the rim of the basin a beautiful purple cloak she had and silver fringes to it and a gold brooch and she had on her a dress of green silk with a long hood embroidered in red gold and wonderful clasps of gold and silver on her breasts and on her shoulders the sunlight was falling on her so that the gold and the green silk were shining out two plaits of hair she had four locks in each plait and a bead at the point of every lock and the colour of her hair was like yellow flags in summet or like red gold after it is rubbed  there she was letting down her hair to wash it and her arms out through the sleeveholes of her shift her soft hands were as white as the snow of a single night and her eyes as blue as any blue flower and her lips as red as the berries of the rowantree and her body as white as the foam of a wave the bright light of the moon was in her face the highness of pride in her    eyebrows a dimple of delight in each of her cheeks the light of wooing in her eyes and when she walked she had a step that was steady and even like the walk of a queen  of all the women of the world she was the best and the nicest and the most beautiful that had ever been seen and it is what king eochaid and his people thought that she was from the hills of the sidhe it is of her it was said all are dear and all are shapely till they are put beside etain  then eochaid sent his people to bring her to him and when she came he said who are you yourself and where do you come from it is easy to say that she said i am etain daughter of etar king of the riders of the sidhe and i have been in this place ever since i was born twenty years ago in a hill of the sidhe and kings and great men among them have been asking my love but they got nothing from me for since the time i could first speak i have loved yourself and given you a childs love because of the great talk i heard of your grandeur and when i saw you now i knew you by all i had heard of you and so i have reached to you at last  it is no bad friend you have been looking for said eochaid but there will be a welcome before you and i will leave every other woman for you and it is with yourself i will live from this out so long as you keep good behaviour  then he gave her the bride price and she lived with him till he died but one time she was brought away from him by midhir and eochaid brought her back by force and the sidhe had no good will towards him after that but brought a revenge on his house and on his grandson conaire  they had one daughter that was called by the same name as her mother etain and that was married to    paragraph continues cormac king of ulster and like her mother she had but the one daughter and there was vexation on cormac when she had no son and he bade two of his servingmen to bring the child away out of his sight and to do away with her so they brought her to a pit but when they were putting her in she smiled a laughing smile at them and they had not the heart to harm her so they brought her to a calfshed belonging to the herds that minded the cattle of eterscel greatgrandson of iar king of teamhair and they cared her well there and there was not a kings daughter in ireland was nicer than herself and they made a little house of wickerwork for her with no door but only a window high up in it  king eterscels people thought it was provisions the herds used to keep in that house but one day a man of them got up and looked in through the window and what he saw was the nicest and the most beautiful young girl of the whole world  when king eterscel heard that he sent his people to break into the house and to bring her away and ask no leave of the cowherds for he had no child and it is what his druids had foretold that it was a woman of unknown race would bear him a son and he was sure this was the woman that had been foretold for him  but before the kings messengers reached the house in the morning etain saw a bird coming in at the window and when it came in it left its birdskin on the floor and what she saw was a man before her and he said the king is sending messengers to bring you to him that he may have a son but it is to me you will bear a son and no bird must ever be killed by him and his name will be conaire son of mes buachall that is son of the cowherds fosterchild  then she was brought away to the king and the herds    that had fostered her went with her and they all got good treatment and it is what she asked when her son conaire was born that he might be brought up between three households the household of her own fosterers and of the two honeyworded maines and her own and she said that if any of the men of ireland had a mind to give help in his bringing up they should give it to those three households  so it was like that the boy was reared and there were five other boys reared along with him ferger fergel ferogain ferobain and lomna druth the fool of the house of dond dessa the champion of the army from muclesi and they all used the same food and their clothing and their armour and the colour of their horses were the same  and after a while king eterscel died and there was a bull feast made ready at teamhair as the custom was to find out by it the best man for the kingship  it is this way the bull feast was made a white bull was killed and one man would eat his fill of the meat and of the broth and in his sleep after that meal a charm of truth would be said over him by four druids and whoever he would see in his sleep would be king and he would tell them his appearance and if he told what was not true his lips would perish and what the dreamer saw in his sleep his time was a young man and he naked and having a stone in his sling passing the road to teamhair  now just at that time conaire was out playing games near the life river with his fosterbrothers and the cowherds that had reared him came and bid him go up to teamhair to attend the bull feast that was going on there  so he left his fosterbrothers at their games and turned his chariot and went on till he came to ath cliath and there he saw great white speckled birds    the best in size and appearance he had ever seen and he followed after them till his horses were tired but he could not come up with them for they always kept just out of his reach then he got down from his chariot and took his sling and followed them to the strand and they went into the sea and were swimming on the waves and he went after them to take hold of them then they left their birdskins and it was men he saw before him and they turning to face him with spears and swords  but one of them took him under his protection and said i am nemglan king of your fathers birds and there was a command put on you never to make a cast at birds for there is not one here but should be dear to you i never knew of that command till this day said conaire then nemglan said what you have to do is to go to teamhair tonight to the bull feast and it is through it you will be made king for it is a man that will go naked and having a sling and a stone in his hand along one of the roads to teamhair towards the end of the night that will be king  and your bird reign will be great he said but there is geasa that is a bond on you not to do these things:  do not go righthandwise round teamhair and lefthandwise round bregia do not hunt the evil beasts of cerna do not go out beyond teamhair every ninth night do not settle the quarrel of two of your own people let no robbery be done in your reign do not sleep in a house you can see the firelight shining from after sunset do not let one woman or one man come into the house where you are after sunset do not let three reds go before you to the house of red  then conaire set out for teamhair naked and having a stone in his sling and on every one of    the four roads to teamhair there were three kings waiting and having clothing with them for the king that was foretold and when the three kings on conaires road saw him coming they met him and put royal clothes on him and brought him in a chariot to teamhair but the people of teamhair said when they saw him: our bull feast and our charm of truth were not worth much when it is only a young beardless lad they have brought us  that is no matter said conaire for it is no disgrace for you to have a young king when my father and my grandfather held the same place that is true they all said then and they gave him the kingship and he said i will learn of wise men that i myself maybe wise  now there was great plenty in ireland through his reign seven ships coining at the one time to inver colptha and corn and nuts up to the knees in every harvest and the trees bending from the weight of fruit and the buais and the boinne full of fish every summer and that much law and peace and goodwill among the people that each one thought the others voice as sweet as the strings of harps and the wolves themselves were held by hostages not to kill more than one calf in every pen there was no thunder or storm in his reign and from spring to harvest there was not as much wind as would stir a cows tail and the cattle were without keepers because of the greatness of peace and in his reign there were the three crowns in ireland the crown of flowers the crown of acorns and the crown of wheatears  but after a while there began to be discontent on the sons of donn dessa because they were hindered from the robbery and killing there used to be in the old time and to vex the king and to see what he would do they stole three things a pig and a bullock and a    cow from the same man every year for three years and every year the countryman would come to the king to make his complaint and every year the king would say it is to the sons of donn dessa you should go for it is they took the beasts but whenever he would go and speak to them they would go near to kill him and he would not go back to the king for fear he might be vexed  so the sons of donn dessa went on with their robbery and three times fifty other young men joined with them sons of the great men of ireland  but one time they went doing their bad work in connaught and they followed a swineherd that ran from them and he called out for help and the people gathered to him and the robbers were taken and brought back to teamhair  king conaire was asked to give judgment then and it is what he said let every father of a robber put his own son to death but let my fosterbrothers be spared give us leave said all the people and we will put them to death for you i will not consent to that indeed said conaire their life must be spared but if they must do robbery he said let them go across the sea and do it on the men of alban  so the sons of donn dessa and their men were driven out of the country and some of the maines went with them the sons of ailell and maeve and three great fighting men of leinster that were called the three red hounds of cualu and they brought a troop of wild restless men with them  they set out then in their ships and when they were out on the rough sea they met with the ship of ingcel the oneeyed grandson of cormac of britain they were going to make an attack on him but ingcel said it would be best for us to come to an agreement together for you have been driven out of ireland and i    myself have been driven out from britain let us make this agreement he said let you come and spoil the people of my country and then i will go back with you and spoil the people of your country  so they agreed to that and they cast lots as to where they would go first and it is how the lot fell that they should go first to britain with ingcel and when they got there it chanced that the father and mother and the seven brothers of ingcel had been sent for to the house of the king of the district and ingcel and his comrades made an attack on them and killed them all in the one night  then they made for alban and there they did every sort of destruction and robbery and at last they turned back again to ireland that ingcel might spoil their people the same way as they had spoiled his  now just at that time peace was after being broken in ireland by the two carbres that were at war with one another in tuathmumain of munster and no one was able to put an end to their quarrel till conaire himself went there to make peace and he did that although by doing it he broke two of the bonds put on him by the man of the waves and on his way back to teamhair when he was passing usnach in meath he and his people thought they saw fighting from east to west and from north to south and armies of naked men and the country of the ua neills like a cloud of fire around them  what is that said conaire it is easy to know that said his people the kings law has broken down and the country is on fire what way had we best go said conaire to the northwest said his people  so then they went righthandways round teamhair and lefthandways round bregia and that was another breaking of his bonds and they met with beasts and    hunted them and he did not know till afterwards that they were the evil beasts of cerna  and it was the sidhe had made that druid mist of smoke about him because he had begun to break his bonds  great fear came on conaire then and he did not know what way would be best to go and they went on by the seacoast towards the south by the road of cualu and then conaire said where shall we go to spend the night  i can say this truly said mac cecht one of his fighting men he that kept three of the fomor as hostages at the kings court the way their people would not spoil corn or milk in ireland through his reign it is oftener the men of ireland have been quarrelling to have you in the house than you have been straying about looking for a lodging i have a friend not far from this said conaire if we but knew the way to his house what is his name said mac cecht da derga of leinster that keeps the great inn said conaire he came to ask a gift of me and it is not a refusal he met with i gave him a hundred head of cattle i gave him a hundred fat swine i gave him a hundred cloaks of fine cloth i gave him a hundred swords and spears i gave him a hundred redgilded brooches i gave him ten vats of good brown ale i gave him three times nine white hounds in silver chains i gave him a hundred swift horses i would give him the same if he would come again he will make a return to me tonight for it would be a strange thing he to begrudge me anything when i come to his house  when i knew his house said mac cecht the road we are in now led straight to it seven doorways there are in it and seven sleepingrooms between every two doorways we will go to the house with all our people said conaire if that is so said mac cecht    paragraph continues i will go on first till i light a fire in the house before you  they went on then towards ath cliath and presently a man with hair cut short with dreadful appearance with but one hand and one foot and one eye overtook them a forked pole of black iron he had in his hand and on his back a blackbristled singed pig and it squealing: and there was a woman coming after him ugly and bigmouthed welcome to you my master conaire he said it is long we have known of your coming who gives that welcome said conaire fer coille the man of the wood he said and his black pig with him that you may not be fasting tonight for you are the best king that ever came into the world leave me for tonight said conaire and i will go to you any other night that pleases you we will not said he but we will go to the place you will be in tonight o fair little master conaire  so he went on towards the inn and his wife behind him and his black pig squealing on his back  after that conaire saw before him three horsemen going towards the inn red cloaks they had and red shields and red spears in their hands and they riding on red horses  what men are these before me said conaire it is my bonds not to let them go before me three reds to the house of red that is of derga who will follow them and bid them to come back and to follow after me i will follow them said lefriflaith conaires son  so he struck his horse and went after them but he could not come up with them so he called to them to turn back and not to go on before the king and he did this three times and the third time one of the men turned his head and said there is great    news before us my son wetting of swords destroying of life shields with broken bosses after the fall of night our horses are tired we are riding the horses of the sidhe although we are alive we are dead and with that they went from him and he went back to his father  you did not keep back the men said conaire it was not my fault indeed said lefriflaith then he told the answer they had given him and conaire and his people were not well pleased to hear that and uneasiness came on them all my bonds are ended tonight said conaire and those three reds before me are sent by the sidhe  now while he and his people were in the road of cuala going towards the inn ingcel and the outlaws of ireland were come in their ships to the coast of bregia against etair and the sons of donn dessa said strike the sails now and let some lightfooted messenger go on shore and see can we keep our bargain with ingcel and give him a spoil for the spoil he gave us let some man go said ingcel that has the gift of hearing and of far sight and of judgement  i have the gift of hearing said maine milscothach i have the gift of far sight and of judgment said maine andoe it is as well for you to go so said the others  so they landed and went on till they came to beinn etair and they stopped there to try what they might see and hear be quiet now said maine milscothach and listen what do you hear said maine andoe i hear the coming of a king he said and look now and tell me what you see i see he said a great company of men travelling over hills and rivers clothes of every colour they have and grey spears over their chariots and swords with    ivory hilts beside them and silver shields and i swear by the oath my people swear by he said the horses they have with them are the horses of some good lord and it is my opinion that it is conaire son of eterscel and a good share of the men of ireland with him that is travelling the road  with that they went back and told their comrades what they had heard and seen and when they heard it they brought the boats to shore and landed on the strand of furbuithe and it was just at the same moment mac cecht was striking a spark to kindle a fire at the inn before the high king  then conaire came to the lawn of the inn and he went in and his people and they took their seats and the three red men sat down along with them and the man of the wood that was a swineherd of the sidhe with his squealing pig  and da derga came to them with three times fifty fighting men every one of them having a long head of hair and a short cloak and a great blackthorn stick with bands of iron in his hand welcome my master conaire said da derga and if you were to bring the whole of the men of ireland with you there would be a welcome before them all  after the fall of evening they saw a lone woman coming to the door of the inn long hair she had and a grey woollen cloak and her mouth was drawn to one side of her head she came and leaned up against the doorpost and she threw an evil eye on the king and the young men about him well woman said conaire if you have the druid sight what is it you see for us it is what i see for you she said that nothing of your skin or of your flesh will escape from the place you are in except what the birds will bring away in their claws and let me come into the house now she said there are bonds on me said conaire not to let one woman come by herself into    the house after the setting of the sun and bring her out he said a good share of food from my own table but let her stop for the night in some other place  if the kings hospitality is gone from him she said and if it is the way with him not to have room in his house for one lone woman to be fed and lodged i will go and get food and lodging from some better man let her in in spite of my bonds said conaire when he heard that so they let her in but none of them felt easy in their minds after what she had said  now all this time the outlaws were on their way to the inn and they stopped at leccaibcend slebe and when they saw the great light that was shining from the inn through the wheels of the chariots that were outside the doors ingcel said to ferogain what is that great light beyond it is what i think said ferogain that it is the fire of conaire the high king and i would be glad he not to be there tonight for it would be a pity if harm would come on him or his life be shortened for he is a branch in its blossom  it is good luck for me said ingcel if he is there spoil for spoil it is no worse for you than it was for me when i gave up my father and mother and my seven brothers and the king of my country into your hands that is true that is true said all the others  then every man of them brought up a stone from the strand to make a cairn as they were used to do before they would make an attack on any place to know by it afterwards how many men they had lost for every man that would come from the fight would take his stone from the cairn and the stones of all that would be killed would be left there  after that they held a council and it is what they agreed that one man should go and spy out what way    things were at the inn and it was ingcel himself went to do that and he was a good while looking in by the seven doors of the house but at last some one of the men inside caught sight of him and he made his way back to his comrades where they were all sitting down and their leaders in the middle waiting to hear his news  did you see the house ingcel said ferogain i did see it said ingcel and whether or not there is a king in it it is a royal house and i will take it as my share when the time comes you may do that said conaires fosterbrothers but we will not go against it before we know who is in it  the first i saw said ingcel was a large man of good race with bright eyes with hair like flax his face open wide above and narrow below with modest looks and having no beard a five barbed spear in his hand and a shield with five gold circles on it nine men he had about him all beautiful and all alike so that you would think they had the one father and mother who were those men ferogain he said  it is easy to say that said ferogain that was cormac conloingeas son of conchubar the best fighter behind a shield in all ireland but he is modest with all that and those were his nine comrades about him they have never put men to death because of their poverty or spared them because of their riches he is a good leader they have with them i swear by the gods my people swear by it is no small slaughter they will make before the inn tonight  it is a pity for him that will make the attack said lomna druth the fool because of that man only cormac conloingeas and if i had my way he said the attack would not be made for the sake of that man alone and his beauty and his goodness  you will not be able to hinder it lomna said    ingcel you are no good of a fighter i know you well there are clouds of weakness coming on you no one whether old man or storyteller will be able to say i drew back from this fight before i had gone through with it  it is well enough for you ingcel said lomna you will escape after the fight and you will bring away the head of a strange king with you but as for myself he said it is my head will be the first to be tossed to and fro tonight  what did you see after that said ferogain  i saw a room with three soft young boys in it and they wearing cloaks of silk with gold brooches long yellow hair they had as curly as a rams head a golden shield and a candle of a kings house over each of them and every one in the house humours them who were those ferogain he said  but ferogain was crying tears down so that the front of his cloak was wet and it was a long time before he could bring out his voice o little ones he said then i have good reason for crying those are the three sons of the king oball and obline and corpre findmor  there is grief on us if that story is true said the other sons of donn dessa for it is good those three are they are as mannerly as young girls and they have the hearts of brothers and the courage of lions whoever has been with them and parts from them it is little he sleeps or eats till the end of nine days fretting after their company it is a pity for him that will destroy them  i saw after that said ingcel a very fair man having a golden bush of hair the size of a reaping basket a long heavy threeedged sword in his hand a red shield speckled with rivets of white bronze between plates of gold    that man is known to all the men of ireland said ferogain it is conall cearnach son of amergin and he is the man conaire thinks most of in the world and that shield in his hand is the lamtapaid there are seven doorways in that inn and when the attack is made conall cearnach will be at every one of them what did you see after that ingcel he said  i saw he said a brown big man with short brown hair and a red speckled cloak and a black shield with clasps of gold and with him two chief men in their first greyness and black swords at their sides and one of them had in his hand a great spear with fifty rivets through it and he shook it over his head and struck the halt against the palm of his hand three times and then he plunged it into a great pot that stood before them with some black thing in it and when he was putting it in there were flames on the shaft who were those men ferogain  that brown man is muinremar son of geirgind one of the champions of the red branch and another is sencha the beautiful son of ailell and the man with the spear is dubthach the beetle of ulster and the spear in his hand is celthairs luin that was in the battle of magh tuireadh and that was brought from the east by the three children of tuireann and when a battle is coming near it flames up of itself and it must be kept quenched in a vessel or it will go through whoever has it in his hand  i saw after that said ingcel a room with nine men in it fairhaired and beautiful with speckled cloaks and above them were nine bagpipes and light was shining from the ornaments that were on them  those are the nine pipers that came to conaire out of the hill of the sidhe at bregia said ferogain because of the great stories about him the best pipers they are in the whole world and they are good fighters but to    fight with them is to fight with a shadow for they kill but cannot be killed because they are from the sidhe  i saw after that said ingcel three very big men with terrible looks a dress of rough hair they had and a club of iron with chains on it in every mans hand there was sadness on them and they standing alone and every one in the house avoiding them who were those ferogain  ferogain was silent for a while and he said then i do not know of any such men in the world unless they might be the three giants cuchulain spared the time he took them from the men of falga he would not let them be killed because of their strangeness conaire bought them from cuchulain after that so it is along with him they are  i saw nine men in the north side of the house said ingcel having very yellow manes of hair and short linen dresses and purple cloaks without brooches broad spears and red curved shields  i know those men said ferogain three royal princes of britain that are with the king oswald and his two fosterbrothers osbrit of the long hand and his two fosterbrothers lindas and his two fosterbrothers  three red men i saw after that said ingcel red shields above them red spears in their bands their three red horses in their bridles in front of the inn  those are the three champions that did deceit and falsehood among the sidhe said ferogain and it is the punishment was put on them by the king of the sidhe to be three times destroyed by the king of teamhair and conaire is the last king through whom they will be destroyed yet they will not be killed nor will they kilt any one it is to work out their own destruction they are come  i saw after that said ingcel a big man and his    hair white and the shame of baldness on him and gold earrings in his ears nine swords he had in his hand and nine silver shields and nine golden apples he was throwing each of them upwards and not one would fall on the ground but each of them rising and falling past each other like bees on a sunny day but as i looked at him he let all fall to the ground and the people about him cried out and the king that was sitting there said to him we have been together since i was a little boy and your tricks never failed till tonight  my grief he said fair master conaire i have good cause for it an unfriendly eye looked at me there is some bad thing in front of the inn  and when the king heard that it is what he said: i had a dream in my sleep a while ago of the howling of my dog ossar of wounded men of a wind of terror of keening that overcame laughter  that was taulchinne conaires juggler said ferogain and tell me now he said what was the appearance of the king  of all the men i ever saw in the world said ingcel he is the best in shape and the most beautiful young he is and wise and kinglike the colour of his hair was like the shining of purified gold the cloak about him was like the mist of a may morning changing from colour to colour every colour more beautiful than another a wheel brooch of gold reaching from his chin to his waist his goldenhiked sword within his reach  that was conaire the high king indeed said ferogain and it is he is the greatest and the best and the comeliest of the kings of the whole world and there is no fault in him either as to wisdom or bravery or knowledge or words or worthiness tender he is a sleepy simple man till he chances on some    brave thing to do but when his anger is awaked the champions of ireland and of scotland will not win their battle so long as he is against them and i swear by the oath my people swear by unless drink should fail him or the like that man alone would hold the inn till help would gather to him from the wave of cliodna in the south to the wave of assaroe in the north  it is time for us to rise up said ingcel then and to get on to the house  so with that the outlaws rose up and went on to the inn and the noise of their voices were heard about it  be quiet now and listen said conaire what is that we hear  fighting men about the house said conall cearnach there are fighting men to meet them here said conaire they will be wanted tonight said conall  then lomna druth the fool broke in first to the house and the doorkeepers struck off his head and it was tossed three times in and out of the inn just as he himself had foretold  then they all attacked one another and conaire himself went out with his people and killed a great many of the outlaws outside and three times the inn was set on fire and three times it was put out again and conaire got to his arms then for he had not got them in the first attack and he went out again and made a great slaughter so that the outlaws were driven back i told you said ferogain that all the men of ireland and of alban could not take the house till conaires rage would be quenched it is short his time will be said the druids that were along with the outlaws and what they put on him by their enchantments was a great thirst so that he went back to the house and called for a drink a drink to me mac cecht he said that is not the order you are used to give me said    paragraph continues mac cecht what i have to do is to keep you from the men that are attacking you all round the house ask a drink of your steward and of your cupbearers he said  then conaire called to his cupbearers for a drink there is none they said for every drop in the house was thrown on the fire to put it out get me a drink mac cecht he said again then for if i am to die it is all the same to me by what death i die  then mac cecht gave a choice to the champions of ireland that were in the house would they go out and look for a drink for conaire or would they stop in the house and defend him and conall cearnach called out: leave the defence of the king to us and go you and look for the drink for it was of you it was asked  and he was vexed with mac cecht for putting the choice to them and there was never a very friendly feeling between them afterwards  then mac cecht went to look for a drink and he brought conaires great golden cup with him and an iron spit the cauldron spit in his other hand  he burst out on the outlaws and attacked them with blows of the spit so that many got their death and then he took his shield and made a round with his sword above his head and cut down all before him and got through the whole band  and it would be too long to tell and it would tire the hearers all that happened after that the people of the inn coming out and making attacks and some of them getting their death and the most part making their escape and at last there were none left in the inn with conaire but conall and sencha and dubthach  now from the rage that was on conaire and the greatness of the fight he had fought a great drouth came on him again and such a fever of thirst and no drink to get that he died of it in the end    then the other three when they saw the high king was dead went out and cut their way through their enemies and got away with their lives but if they did they were wounded and hurt and broken  and conall cearnach after he got away went on to his fathers house and but half his shield in his hand and a few bits left of his two spears and he found amergin his father out before his dun in tailltin  those are fierce wolves that have hunted you my son said he it was not wolves that wounded me but a sharp fight with fightingmen said conall have you news from da dergas inn said amergin is your lord living he is not living said
