every year the men of ulster were accustomed to hold festival together and the time when they held it was for three days before samhain the summerend and for three days after that day and upon samhain itself and the time that is spoken of is that when the men of ulster were in the plain of murthemne and there they used to keep that festival every year nor was there an thing in the world that they would do at that time except sports and marketings and splendours and pomps and feasting and eating and it is from that custom of theirs that the festival of the samhain has descended that is now held throughout the whole of ireland  now once upon a time the men of ulster held festival upon the murthemne plain and the reason that this festival was held was that every man of them should then give account of the combats he had made and of his valour every summerend it was their custom to hold that festival in order to give account of these combats and the manner in which they gave that account was this: each man used to cut off the tip of the tongue of a foe whom he had killed and he bore it with him in a pouch moreover in order to make more great the numbers of their contests some used to bring with them the tips of the tongues of beasts and each man publicly declared the fights he had fought one man of them after the other and they did this alsothey laid their swords over their thighs when they declared the strifes and their own swords used to turn against them when the strife that they declared was false nor was this to be wondered at for at that time it was customary for demon beings to scream from the weapons of men so that for this cause their weapons might be the more able to guard them  to that festival then came all the men of ulster except two alone and these two were fergus the son of rg and conall the victorious let the festival be held cried the men of ulster nay said cuchulain it shall not be held until conall and fergus come and this he said because fergus was the fosterfather of cuchulain and conall was his comrade then said sencha: let us for the present engage in games of chess and let the druids sing and let the jugglers play their feats and it was done as he had said  now while they were thus employed a flock of birds came down and hovered over the lake never was seen in ireland more beautiful birds than these and a longing that these birds should be given to them seized upon the women who were there and each of them began to boast of the prowess of her husband at birdcatching how i wish said ethne aitencaithrech conors wife that i could have two of those birds one of them upon each of my two shoulders it is what we all long for said the women and if any should have this boon i should be the first one to have it said ethne inguba the wife of cuchulain  what are we to do now said the women tis easy to answer you said leborcham the daughter of oa and adarc i will go now with a message from you and will seek for cuchulain she then went to cuchulain and the women of ulster would be well pleased she said if yonder birds were given to them by thy hand and cuchulain made for his sword to unsheathe it against her: cannot the lasses of ulster find any other but us he said to give them their birdhunt today tis not seemly for thee to rage thus against them said leborcham for it is on thy account that the women of ulster have assumed one of their three blemishes even the blemish of blindness for there were three blemishes that the women of ulster assumed that of crookedness of gait and that of a stammering in their speech and that of blindness each of the women who loved conall the victorious had assumed a crookedness of gait each woman who loved cuscraid mend the stammerer of macha conors son stammered in her speech each woman in like manner who loved cuchulain had assumed a blindness of her eyes in order to resemble cuchulain for he when his mind was angry within him was accustomed to draw in the one of his eyes so far that a crane could not reach it in his head and would thrust out the other so that it was great as a cauldron in which a calf is cooked  yoke for us the chariot o laeg said cuchulain and laeg yoked the chariot at that and cuchulain went into the chariot and he cast his sword at the birds with a cast like the cast of a boomerang so that they with their claws and wings flapped against the water and they seized upon all the birds and they gave them and distributed them among the women nor was there any one of the women except ethne alone who had not a pair of those birds then cuchulain returned to his wife and thou art enraged said he to her i am in no way enraged answered ethne for i deem it as being by me that the distribution was made and thou hast done what was fitting she said for there is not one of these woman but loves thee none in whom thou hast no share but for myself none hath any share in me except thou alone be not angry said cuchulain if in the future any birds come to the plain of murthemne or to the boyne the two birds that are the most beautiful among those that come shall be thine  a little while after this they saw two birds flying over the lake linked together by a chain of red gold they sang a gentle song and a sleep fell upon all the men who were there and cuchulain rose up to pursue the birds if thou wilt hearken to me said laeg and so also said ethne thou shalt not go against them behind those birds is some especial power other birds may be taken by thee at some future day is it possible that such claim as this should be made upon me said cuchulain place a stone in my sling o laeg laeg thereon took a stone and he placed it in the sling and cuchulain launched the stone at the birds but the cast missed alas said he he took another stone and he launched this also at the birds but the stone flew past them wretched that i am he cried since the very first day that i assumed arms i have never missed a cast until this day and he cast his spear at them and the spear went through the shield of the wing of one of the birds and the birds flew away and went beneath the lake  after this cuchulain departed and he rested his back against a stone pillar and his soul was angry within him and a sleep fell upon him then saw he two women come to him the one of them had a green mantle upon her and upon the other was a purple mantle folded in five folds and the woman in the green mantle approached him and she laughed a laugh at him and she gave him a stroke with a horsewhip and then the other approached him and she also laughed at him and she struck him in the like manner and for a long time were they thus each of them in turn coming to him and striking him until he was all but dead and then they departed from him  now the men of ulster perceived the state in which cuchulain was in and they cried out that he should be awakened but nay said fergus ye shall not move him for he seeth a vision and a little after that cuchulain came from his sleep what hath happened to thee said the men of ulster but he had no power to bid greeting to them let me be carried he said to the sickbed that is in tete brecc neither to dun imrith nor yet to dun delga wilt thou not be carried to dun delga to seek for emer said laeg nay said he my word is for tete brecc and thereon they bore him from that place and he was in tete brecc until the end of one year and during all that time he had speech with no one  now upon a certain day before the next summerend at the end of a year when the men of ulster were in the house where cuchulain was fergus being at the sidewall and conall cernach at his head and lugaid redstripes at his pillow and ethne inguba at his feet when they were there in this manner a man came to them and he seated himself near the entrance of the chamber in which cuchulain lay what hath brought thee here said conall the victorious no hard question to answer said the man if the man who lies yonder were in health he would be a good protection to all of ulster in the weakness and the sickness in which he now is so much the more great is the protection that they have from him i have no fear of any of you he said for it is to give to this man a greeting that i come welcome to thee then and fear nothing said the men of ulster and the man rose to his feet and he sang them these staves:  ah cuchulain who art under sickness still     not long thou its cure shouldst need soon would aed abras daughters to heal thine ill     to thee at thy bidding speed  liban she at swift labras right hand who sits     stood up on cruachs plain and cried: tis the wish of fands heart she the tale permits     to sleep at cuchulains side  if cuchulain would come to me fand thus told     how goodly that day would shine then on high would our silver be heaped and gold     our revellers pour the wine  and if now in my land as my friend had been     cuchulain of sualtam son the things that in visions he late hath seen     in peace would he safe have won  in the plains of murthemne to south that spread     shall liban my word fulfil: she shall seek him on samhain he naught need dread     by her shall be cured his ill who art thou then thyself said the men of ulster i am angus the son of aed abra he answered and the man then left them nor did any of them know whence it was he had come nor whither he went  then cuchulain sat up and he spoke to them fortunate indeed is this said the men of ulster tell us what it is that hath happened to thee upon samhain night last year he said i indeed saw a vision and he told them of all he had seen what should now be done father conor said cuchulain this hast thou to do answered conor rise and go until thou comest to the pillar where thou wert before  then cuchulain went forth until he came to the pillar and then saw he the woman in the green mantle come to him this is good o cuchulain said she tis no good thing in my thought said cuchulain wherefore camest thou to me last year he said it was indeed to do no injury to thee that we came said the woman but to seek for thy friendship i have come to greet thee she said from fand the daughter of aed abra her husband manannan the son of the sea hath released her and she hath thereon set her love on thee my own name is liban and i have brought to thee a message from my spouse labraid the swift the swordwielder that he will give thee the woman in exchange for one days service to him in battle against senach the unearthly and against eochaid juiland against yeogan the stream i am in no fit state he said to contend with men today that will last but a little while she said thou shalt be whole and all that thou hast lost of thy strength shall be increased to thee labraid shall bestow on thee that boon for he is the best of all warriors that are in the world  where is it that labraid dwelleth asked cuchulain  in mag mell the plain of delight said liban and now i desire to go to another land said she  let laeg go with thee said cuchulain that he may learn of the land from which thou hast come let him come then said liban  they departed after that and they went forward until they came to a place where fand was and liban turned to seek for laeg and she set him upon her shoulder thou wouldest never go hence o laeg said liban wert thou not under a womans protection tis not a thing that i have most been accustomed to up to this time said laeg to be under a womans guard shame and everlasting shame said liban that cuchulain is not where thou art it were well for me answered laeg if it were indeed he who is here  they passed on then and went forward until they came opposite to the shore of an island and there they saw a skiff of bronze lying upon the lake before them they entered into the skiff and they crossed over to the island and came to the palace door and there they saw the man and he came towards them and thus spoke liban to the man whom they saw there:  say where he the handonsword     labra swift abideth he who of the triumphs lord     in strong chariot rideth when victorious troops are led     labra hath the leading he it is when spears are red     sets the points ableeding and the man replied to her and spoke thus: labra who of speed is son     comes and comes not slowly crowded hosts together run     bent on warfare wholly soon upon the forest plain     shall be set the killing for the hour when men are slain     fidgas fields are filling they entered then into the palace and they saw there thrice fifty couches within the palace and three times fifty women upon the couches and the women all bade laeg welcome and it was in these words that they addressed him:  hail for the guide laeg of thy quest: laeg we beside hail as our guest what wilt thou do now said liban wilt thou go on without a delay and hold speech with fand  i will go he answered if i may know the place where she is  that is no hard matter to tell thee she answered she is in her chamber apart they went therein and they greeted fand and she welcomed laeg in the same fashion as the others had done  fand is the daughter of aed abra aed means fire and he is the fire of the eye: that is of the eyes pupil: fand moreover is the name of the tear that runs from the eye it was on account of the clearness of her beauty that she was so named for there is nothing else in the world except a tear to which her beauty could be likened  now while they were thus in that place they heard the rattle of labraids chariot as he approached the island the spirit of labraid is gloomy today said liban i will go and greet him and she went out and she bade welcome to labraid and she spoke as follows:  hail the man who holdeth sword the swift in fight heir of little armies armed with javelins light spears he drives in splinters bucklers bursts in twain limbs of men are wounded nobles by him slain he for error searcheth streweth gifts not small hosts of men destroyeth fairer he than all heroes whom he findeth feel his fierce attack labra swiftest swordhand welcome to us back labraid made no reply to her and the lady spoke again thus: welcome swift labra     hand to sword set all win thy bounty     praise thou shalt get warfare thou seekest     wounds seam thy side wisely thou speakest     law canst decide kindly thou rulest     wars fightest well wrongdoers schoolest     hosts shalt repel labraid still made no answer and she sang another lay thus: labra all hail     swordwielder swift: war can he wage     warriors can sift valiant is he     fighters excels more than in sea     pride in him swells down in the dust     strength doth he beat they who him trust     rise to their feet weak ones hell raise     humble the strong labra thy praise     peals loud and long thou speakest not rightly o lady said labraid and he then spoke to her thus: o my wife naught of boasting or pride is in me no renown would i claim and no falsehood shall be: lamentation alone stirs my mind for hard spears rise in numbers against me: dread contest appears: the right arms of their heroes red broadswords shall swing many hosts eochaid juil holds to heart as their king: let no pride then be ours no high words let there be pride and arrogance far should be lady from me let now thy mind be appeased said the lady liban to him laeg the charioteer of cuchulain is here and cuchulain hath sent word to thee that he will come to join thy hosts  then labraid bade welcome to laeg and he said to him: welcome o laeg for the sake of the lady with whom thou comest and for the sake of him from whom thou hast come do thou now go to thine own land o laeg said labraid and liban shall accompany thee  then laeg returned to emain and he gave news of what he had seen to cuchulain and to all others beside and cuchulain rose up and he passed his hand over his face and he greeted laeg brightly and his mind was strengthened within him for the news that the lad had brought him  at this point occurs the break in the story indicated in the preface and the description of the bullfeast at which lugaid redstripes is elected king over all ireland also the exhortation that cuchulain supposed to be lying on his sickbed gives to lugaid as to the duties of a king after this insertion which has no real connection with the story the story itself proceeds but from another point for the thread is taken up at the place where cuchulain has indeed awaked from his trance but is still on his sickbed the message of angus appears to have been given but cuchulain does not seem to have met liban for the second time nor to have sent laeg to inquire ethne has disappeared as an actor from the scene her place is taken by emer cuchulains real wife and the whole style of the romance so alters for the better that even if it were not for the want of agreement of the two versions we could see that we have here two tales founded upon the same legend but by two different hands the end of the first and the beginning of the second alike missing and the gap filled in by the story of the election of lugaid  now as to cuchulain it has to be related thus: he called upon laeg to come to him and do thou go o laeg said cuchulain to the place where emer is and say to her that women of the fairies have come upon me and that they have destroyed my strength and say also to her that it goeth better with me from hour to hour and bid her to come and seek me and the young man laeg then spoke these words in order to hearten the mind of cuchulain:                      it fits not heroes lying             on sickbed in a sickly sleep to dream:                     witches before thee flying             of trogachs fiery plain the dwellers seem:                     they have beat down thy strength                     made thee captive at length     and in womanish folly away have they driven thee far                      arise no more be sickly             shake off the weakness by those fairies sent:                     for from thee parteth quickly             thy strength that for the chariotchiefs was meant:                     thou crouchest like a youth                     art thou subdued in truth     have they shaken thy prowess and deeds that were meet for the war              yet labras power hath sent his message plain:             rise thou that crouchest: and be great again  and laeg after that heartening departed and he went on until he came to the place where emer was and he told her of the state of cuchulain: ill hath it been what thou hast done o youth she said for although thou art known as one who dost wander in the lands where the fairies dwell yet no virtue of healing hast thou found there and brought for the cure of thy lord shame upon the men of ulster she said for they have not sought to do a great deed and to heal him yet had conor thus been fettered had it been fergus who had lost his sleep had it been conall the victorious to whom wounds had been dealt cuchulain would have saved them and she then sang a song and in this fashion she sang it:  laeg who oft the fairy hill searchest slack i find thee still lovely dechtires son shouldst thou by thy zeal have healed ere now  ulster though for bounties famed fostersire and friends are shamed: none hath deemed cuchulain worth one full journey through the earth  yet if sleep on fergus fell such that magic arts dispel dechtires son had restless rode till a druid raised that load  aye had conall come from wars weak with wounds and recent scars all the world our hound would scour till he found a healing power  were it laegaire war had pressed erins meads would know no rest till made whole from wounds he won machs grandchild connas son  had thus crafty celthar slept long like him by sickness kept through the elfmounds night and day would our hound to heal him stray  furbaid girt by heroes strong were it he had lain thus long ah our hound would rescue bear though through solid earth he fare  all the elves of troom seem dead all their mighty deeds have fled for their hound who hounds surpassed elves have bound in slumber fast  ah on me thy sickness swerves hound of smith who conor serves sore my heart my flesh must be: may thy cure be wrought by me  ah tis blood my heart that stains sick for him who rode the plains: though his land be decked for feast he to seek its plain hath ceased  he in emain still delays tis those shapes the bar that raise: weak my voice is dead its tone he in evil form is shown  monthlong yearlong watch i keep seasons pass i know not sleep: mens sweet speech strikes not mine ear naught riangabras son i hear and after that she had sung that song emer went forward to emain that she might seek for cuchulain and she seated herself in the chamber where cuchulain was and thus she addressed him: shame upon thee she said to lie thus prostrate for a womans love well may this long sickbed of thine cause thee to ail and it was in this fashion that she addressed him and she chanted this lay:  stand up o thou hero of ulster     wake from sleep rise up joyful and sound look on conor the king on my beauty     will that loose not those slumbers profound  see the ulstermens clear shining shoulders     hear their trumpets that call to the fight see their warcars that sweep through the valleys     as in herochess leaping each knight  see their chiefs and the strength that adorns them     their tall maidens so stately with grace the swift kings springing on to the battle     the great queens of the ulstermens race  the clear winter but now is beginning     lo the wonder of cold that hangs there tis a sight that should warn thee how chilly     of what length yet of colour how bare  this long slumber is ill it decays thee:     tis like milk for the full the saw saith hard is war with fatigue deadly weakness     is a prince who stands second to death  wake tis joy for the sodden this slumber     throw it off with a great glowing heat: sweetvoiced friends for thee wait in great number:     ulsters champion stand up on thy feet and cuchulain at her word stood up and he passed his hand over his face and he cast all his heaviness and his weariness away from him and then he arose and went on his way before him until he came to the enclosure that he sought and in that enclosure liban appeared to him and liban spoke to him and she strove to lead him into the fairy hill but what place is that in which labraid dwelleth said cuchulain it is easy for me to tell thee she said:  labras homes a pure lake whither     troops of women come and go easy paths shall lead thee thither     where thou shalt swift labra know  hundreds his skilled arm repelleth     wise be they his deeds who speak: look where rosy beauty dwelleth     like to that think labras cheek  head of wolf for gore that thirsteth     near his thin red falchion shakes shields that cloak the chiefs he bursteth     arms of foolish foes he breaks  trust of friend he aye requiteth     scarred his skin like bloodshot eye first of fairy men he fighteth     thousands by him smitten die  chiefs at echaid juils name tremble     yet his landstrange talehe sought he whose locks gold threads resemble     with whose breath winescents are brought  more than all strifeseekers noted     fiercely to far lands he rides steeds have trampled skiffs have floated     near the isle where he abides  labra swift swordwielder gaineth     fame for actions over sea sleep for all his watch sustaineth     sure no coward hound is he  the chains on the necks of the coursers he rides     and their bridles are ruddy with gold: he hath columns of crystal and silver besides     the roof of his house to uphold i will not go thither at a womans call said cuchulain let laeg then go said the lady and let him bring to thee tidings of all that is there let him depart then said cuchulain and laeg rose up and departed with liban and they came to the plain of speech and to the tree of triumphs and over the festal plain of emain and over the festal plain of fidga and in that place was aed abra and with him his daughters  then fand bade welcome to laeg and how is it said she that cuchulain hath not come with thee it pleased him not said laeg to come at a womans call moreover he desired to know whether it was indeed from thee that had come the message and to have full knowledge of everything it was indeed from me that the message was sent she said and let now cuchulain come swiftly to seek us for it is for today that the strife is set then laeg went back to the place where he had left cuchulain and liban with him and how appeareth this quest to thee o laeg said cuchulain and laeg answering said in a happy hour shalt thou go said he for the battle is set for today and it was in this manner that he spake and he recited thus:  i went gaily through regions     though strange seen before: by his cairn found i labra     a cairn for a score  there sat yellowhaired labra     his spears round him rolled his long bright locks well gathered     round apple of gold  on my fivefolded purple     his glance at length fell and he said come and enter     where failbe doth dwell  in one house dwells white failbe     with labra his friend and retainers thrice fifty     each monarch attend  on the right couches fifty     where fifty men rest on the left fifty couches     by mens weight oppressed  for each couch copper frontings     posts golden and white and a rich flashing jewel     as torch gives them light  near that house to the westward     where sunlight sinks down stand grey steeds with manes dappled     and steeds purplebrown  on its east side are standing     three bright purple trees whence the birds songs oft ringing     the kings children please  from a tree in the forecourt     sweet harmony streams it stands silver yet sunlit     with golds glitter gleams  sixty trees swaying summits     now meet now swing wide rindless food for thrice hundred     each drops at its side  near a well by that palace     gay cloaks spread out lie each with splendid gold fastening     well hooked through its eye  they who dwell there find flowing     a vat of glad ale: tis ordained that for ever     that vat shall not fail  from the hall steps a lady     well gifted and fair: none is like her in erin     like gold is her hair  and so sweet and so wondrous     her words from her fall that with love and with longing     she breaks hearts of all  who art thou said that lady     for strange thou art here but if him of murthemne     thou servest draw near  slowly slowly i neared her     i feared for my fame: and she said comes he hither     of dechtire who came  ah long since for thy healing     thou there shouldst have gone and have viewed that great palace     before me that shone  though i ruled all of erin     and yellow bregs hill id give all no small trial     to know that land still the quest then is a good one said cuchulain it is goodly indeed said laeg and it is right that thou shouldest go to attain it and all things in that land are good and thus further also spoke laeg as he told of the loveliness of the fairy dwelling:  i saw a land of noble form and splendid     where dwells naught evil none can speak a lie: there stands the king by all his hosts attended     brown labra swift to sword his hand can fly  we crossed the plain of speech our steps arrested     near to that tree whose branches triumphs bear at length upon the hillcrowned plain we rested     and saw the doubleheaded serpents lair  then liban said as we that mount sat under:     would i could seetwould be a marvel strange yet if i saw it dear would be that wonder     if to cuchulains form thy form could change  great is the beauty of aed abras daughters     unfettered men before them conquered fall fands beauty stuns like sound of rushing waters     before her splendour kings and queens seem small  though i confess as from the wise ones hearing     that adams race was once unstained by sin yet did i swear when fand was there appearing     none in past ages could such beauty win  i saw the champions stand with arms for slaying     right splendid was the garb those heroes bore gay coloured garments meet for their arraying     twas not the vesture of rude churls they wore  women of music at the feast were sitting     a brilliant maiden bevy near them stood and forms of noble youths were upwards flitting     through the recesses of the mountain wood  i saw the folk of song their strains rang sweetly     as for the lady in that house they played had i not i fled away from thence and fleetly     hurt by that music i had weak been made  i know the hill where ethne took her station     and ethne ingubas a lovely maid but none can drive from sense a warlike nation     save she alone in beauty then displayed and cuchulain when he had heard that report went on with liban to that land and he took his chariot with him and they came to the island of labraid and there labraid and all the women that were there bade them welcome and fand gave an especial welcome to cuchulain what is there now set for us to do said cuchulain no hard matter to answer said labraid we must go forth and make a circuit about the army they went out then and they came to the army and they let their eyes wander over it and the host seemed to them to be innumerable do thou arise and go hence for the present said cuchulain to labraid and labraid departed and cuchulain remained confronting the army and there were two ravens there who spake and revealed druid secrets but the armies who heard them laughed it must surely be the madman from ireland who is there said the army it is he whom the ravens would make known to us and the armies chased them away so that they found no restingplace in that land  spearmannow at early morn eochaid juil went out in order to bathe his hands in the spring and cuchulain saw his shoulder through the hood of his tunic and he hurled his spear at him and he pierced him and he by himself slew thirtyandthree of them and then senach the unearthly assailed him and a great fight was fought between them and cuchulain slew him and after that labraid approached and he brake before him those armies  then labraid entreated cuchulain to stay his hand from the slaying and i fear now said laeg that the man will turn his wrath upon us for he hath not found a war to suffice him go now said laeg and let there be brought three vats of cold water to cool his heat the first vat into which he goeth shall boil over after he hath gone into the second vat none shall be able to bear the heat of it: after he hath gone into the third vat its water shall have but a moderate heat  and when the women saw cuchulains return fand sang thus:  fidgas plain where the feast assembles     shakes this eve as his car he guides all the land at the trampling trembles     young and beardless in state he rides  bloodred canopies oer him swinging     chant but not as the fairies cry deeper bass from the car is singing     deeply droning its wheels reply  steeds are bounding beneath the traces     none to match them my thought can find wait a while i would note their graces:     on they sweep like the springs swift wind  high in air in his breath suspended     float a fifty of golden balls kings may grace in their sports have blended     none his equal my mind recalls  dimples four on each cheek are glowing     one seems green one is tinged with blue one dyed red as if blood were flowing     one is purple of lightest hue  sevenfold light from his eyeballs flashes     none may speak him as blind in scorn proud his glances and dark eyelashes     black as beetle his eyes adorn  well his excellence fame confesses     all through erin his praise is sung three the hues of his highpiled tresses     beardless yet and a stripling young  red his blade it hath late been blooded     shines above it its silver hilt golden bosses his shield have studded     round its rim the white bronze is spilt  oer the slain in each slaughter striding     war he seeketh at risk would snatch: heroes keen in your ranks are riding     none of these is cuchulains match  from murthemne he comes we greet him     young cuchulain the champion strong we compelled from afar to meet him     daughters all of aed abra throng  every tree as a lordly token     stands all stained with the red blood rain war that demons might wage is woken     wails peal high as he raves again liban moreover bade a welcome to cuchulain and she chanted as follows:         hail to cuchulain             lord who canst aid         murthemne ruling             mind undismayed         herolike glorious             heart great and still         battlevictorious             firm rock of skill         redly he rageth             foemen would face         battle he wageth             meet for his race brilliant his splendour like maidens eyes praises we render: praise shall arise tell us now of the deeds thou hast done o cuchulain cried liban and cuchulain in this manner replied to her:  from my hand flew a dart as i made my cast through the host of streamyeogan the javelin passed not at all did i know though great fame was won who my victim had been or what deed was done  whether greater or less was his might than mine i have found not at all nor can right divine in a mist was he hid whom my spear would slay yet i know that he went not with life away  a great host on me closed and on every side rose around me in hordes the red steeds they ride from manannan the son of the sea came foes from streamyeogan to call them a roar arose  and i went to the battle with all at length when my weakness had passed and i gat full strength and alone with three thousands the fight i fought till death to the foes whom i faced was brought  i heard echaid juils groan as he neared his end the sound came to mine ears as from lips of friend yet if truth must be told twas no valiant deed that cast that i threw if twas thrown indeed now after all these things had passed cuchulain slept with the lady and he abode for a month in her company and at the end of the month he came to bid her farewell tell me she said to what place i may go for our tryst and i will be there and they made tryst at the strand that is known as the strand of the yewtrees head  now word was brought to emer of that tryst and knives were whetted by emer to slay the lady and she came to the place of the tryst and fifty women were with her and there she found cuchulain and laeg and they were engaged in the chessplay so that they perceived not the womens approach but fand marked it and she cried out to laeg: look now o laeg she said and mark that sight that i see what sight is that of which thou speakest said laeg and he looked and saw it and thus it was that the lady even fand addressed him:              laeg look behind thee                 close to thine ear             wise wellranked women                 press on us near             bright on each bosom                 shines the gold clasp             knives with green edges                 whetted they grasp:     as for the slaughter chariot chiefs race     comes forgalls daughter changed is her face      have no fear said cuchulain no foe shalt thou meet     enter thou my strong car with its sunny bright seat:     i will set thee before me will guard thee from harm     against women from ulsters four quarters that swarm:     though the daughter of forgall the war with thee vows     though her dear fostersisters against thee she rouse     no deed of destruction bold emer will dare     though she rageth against thee for i will be there moreover to emer he said:  i avoid thee o lady as heroes     avoid to meet friends in a strife the hard spear thy hand shakes cannot injure     nor the blade of thy thin gleaming knife for the wrath pent within thee that rageth     is but weak nor can cause mine affright: it were hard if the war my might wageth     must be quenched by a weak womans might  speak and tell me cuchulain cried emer     why this shame on my head thou wouldst lay before women of ulster dishonoured i stand     and all women who dwell in the wide irish land and all folk who love honour beside:     though i came on thee secretly creeping though oppressed by thy might i remain     and though great is thy pride in the battle if thou leavest me naught is thy gain:     why dear youth such attempt dost thou make  speak thou emer and say said cuchulain     should i not with this lady delay for this lady is fair pare and bright and well skilled     a fit mate for a monarch in beauty fulfilled and the billows of ocean can ride:     she is lovely in countenance lofty in race and with handicraft skilled can fine needlework trace     hath a mind that with firmness can guide:  and in steeds hath she wealth and much cattle     doth she own there is naught under sky a dear wife for a spouse should be keeping     but that gift with this lady have i: though the vow that i made thee i break thou shalt neer find champion     rich like me in scars neer such worth such brilliance     none who wins my wars in good sooth answered emer the lady to whom thou dost cling is in no way better than am i myself yet fair seems all thats red seems white whats new alone and bright whats set oerhead and sour are things well known men worship what they lack and what they have seems weak in truth thou hast all the wisdom of the time o youth she said once we dwelled in honour together and we would so dwell again if only i could find favour in thy sight and her grief weighed heavily upon her by my word said cuchulain thou dost find favour and thou shalt find it so long as i am in life  desert me then cried fand nay said emer it is more fitting that i should be the deserted one not so indeed said fand it is i who must go and danger rusheth upon me from afar and an eagerness for lamentation seized upon fand and her soul was great within her for it was shame to her to be deserted and straightway to return to her home moreover the mighty love that she bare to cuchulain was tumultuous in her and in this fashion she lamented and lamenting sang this song:  mighty need compels me     i must go my way fame for others waiteth     would i here could stay  sweeter were it resting     guarded by thy power than to find the marvels     in aed abras bower  emer noble lady     take thy man to thee: though my arms resign him     longing lives in me  oft in shelters hidden     men to seek me came none could win my trysting     i myself was flame  ah no maid her longing     on a man should set till a love full equal     to her own she get  fifty women hither     emer thou hast brought thou wouldst fand make captive     hast on murder thought  till the day i need them     waits my home within thrice thy host fair virgins     these my war shall win now upon this it was discerned by manannan that fand the daughter of aed abra was engaged in unequal warfare with the women of ulster and that she was like to be left by cuchulain and thereon manannan came from the east to seek for the lady and he was perceived by her nor was there any other conscious of his presence saving fand alone and when she saw manannan the lady was seized by great bitterness of mind and by grief and being thus she made this song:  lo the son of the seafolk from plains draws near     whence yeogan the stream is poured tis manannan of old he to me was dear     and above the fair world we soared  yet today although excellent sounds his cry     no love fills my noble heart for the pathways of love may be bent awry     its knowledge in vain depart  when i dwelt in the bower of the yeogan stream     at the son of the oceans side of a life there unending was then our dream     naught seemed could our love divide  when the comely manannan to wed me came     to me as a spouse full meet not in shame was i sold in no chessmens game     the price of a foes defeat  when the comely manannan my lord was made     when i was his equal spouse this armlet of gold that i bear he paid     as price for my marriage vows  through the heather came bridemaids in garments brave     of all colours two score and ten and beside all the maidens my bounty gave     to my husband a fifty men  four times fifty our host for no frenzied strife     in our palace was pent that throng where a hundred strong men led a gladsome life     one hundred fair dames and strong  manannan draws near: over ocean he speeds     from all notice of fools is he free as a horseman he comes for no vessel he needs     who rides the maned waves of the sea  he hath passed near us now though his visage to view     is to all save to fairies forbid every troop of mankind his keen sight searcheth through     though small and in secret though hid  but for me this resolve in my spirit shall dwell     since weak being womans my mind since from him whom so dearly i loved and so well     only danger and insult i find  i will go in mine honour unsullied depart     fair cuchulain i bid thee goodbye i have gained not the wish that was dear to my heart     high justice compels me to fly  it is flight this alone that befitteth my state     though to some shall this parting be hard: o thou son of riangabra the insult was great:     not by laeg shall my going be barred  i depart to my spouse neer to strife with a foe     shall manannan his consort expose and that none may complain that in secret i go     behold him his form i disclose then that lady rose behind manannan as he passed and manannan greeted her: o lady he said which wilt thou do wilt thou depart with me or abide here until cuchulain comes to thee by my troth answered fand either of the two of ye were a fitting spouse to adhere to and neither of you two is better than the other yet manannan it is with thee that i go nor will i wait for cuchulain for he hath betrayed me and there is another matter moreover that weigheth with me o thou noble prince said she and that is that thou hast no consort who is of worth equal to thine but such a one hath cuchulain already  and cuchulain saw the lady as she went from him to manannan and he cried out to laeg: what meaneth this that i see tis no hard matter to answer thee said laeg fand goeth away with manannan the son of the sea since she hath not been pleasing in thy sight  then cuchulain bounded three times high into the air and he made three great leaps towards the south and thus he came to tara luachra and there he abode for a long time having no meat and no drink dwelling upon the mountains and sleeping upon the highroad that runneth through the midst of luachra  then emer went on to emain and there she sought out king conor and she told conor of cuchulains state and conor sent out his learned men and the people of skill and the druids of ulster that they might seek for cuchulain and might bind him fast and bring him with them to emain and cuchulain strove to slay the people of skill but they chanted wizard and fairy songs against him and they bound fast his feet and his hands until he came a little to his senses then he begged for a drink at their hands and the druids gave him a drink of forgetfulness so that afterwards he had no more remembrance of fand nor of anything else that he had then done and they also gave a drink of forgetfulness to emer that she might forget her jealousy for her state was in no way better than the state of cuchulain and manannan shook his cloak between cuchulain and fand so that they might never meet together again throughout eternity
