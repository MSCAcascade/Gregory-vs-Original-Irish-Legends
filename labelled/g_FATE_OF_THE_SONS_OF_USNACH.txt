fate of the sons of usnach  now it was one fedlimid son of doll was harper to king conchubar and he had but one child and this is the story of her birth  cathbad the druid was at fedlimids house one day have you got knowledge of the future said fedlimid i have a little said cathbad what is it you are wanting to know i was not asking to know anything said fedlimid but if you know of anything that may be going to happen to me it is as well for you to tell me  cathbad went out of the house for a while and when he came back he said: had you ever any children i never had said fedlimid and the wife i have had none and we have no hope ever to have any there is no one with us but only myself and my wife that puts wonder on me said cathbad for i see by druid signs that it is on account of a daughter belonging to you that more blood will be shed than ever was shed in ireland since time and race began and great heroes and bright candles of the gad will lose their lives because of her is that the foretelling you have made for me said fedlimid and there was anger on him for he thought the druid was mocking him if that is all you can say you can keep it for yourself it is little i think of your share    of knowledge for all that said cathbad i am certain of its truth for i can see it all clearly in my own mind  the druid went away but he was not long gone when fedlimids wife was found to be with child and as her time went on his vexation went on growing that he had not asked more questions of cathbad at the time he was talking to him and he was under a smouldering care by day and by night for it is what he was thinking that neither his own sense and understanding or the share of friends he had would be able to save him or to make a back against the world if this misfortune should come upon him that would bring such great shedding of blood upon the earth and it is the thought that came that if this child should be born what he had to do was to put her far away where no eye would see her and no ear hear word of her  the time of the delivery of fedlimids wife came on and it was a girlchild she gave birth to fedlimid did not allow any living person to come to the house or to see his wife but himself alone  but just after the child was born cathbad the druid came in again and there was shame on fedlimid when he saw him and when he remembered how he would not believe his words but the druid looked at the child and he said: let deirdre be her name harm will come through her  she will be fair comely brighthaired heroes will fight for her and kings go seeking for her  and then he took the child in his arms and it is what he said: o deirdre on whose account many shall weep on whose account many women shall be envious there will be trouble on ulster for your sake o fair daughter of fedlimid  many will be jealous of your face o flame of beauty for your sake heroes shall go to exile for    your sake deeds of anger shall be done in emain there is harm in your face for it will bring banishment and death on the sons of kings  in your fate o beautiful child are wounds and illdoings and shedding of blood  you will have a little grave apart to yourself you will be a tale of wonder for ever deirdre  cathbad went away then and he sent levarcham daughter of aedh to the house and fedlimid asked her would she take the venture of bringing up the child far away where no eye would see her and no ear hear of her levarcham said she would do that and that she would do her best to keep her the way he wished  so fedlimid got his men and brought them away with him to a mountain wide and waste and there he bade them to make a little house by the side of a round green hillock and to make a garden of appletrees behind it with a wall about it and he bade them put a roof of green sods over the house the way a little company might live in it without notice being taken of them  then he sent levarcham and the child there that no eye might see and no ear hear of deirdre he put all in good order before them and he gave them provisions and he told levarcham that food and all she wanted would be sent from year to year as long as she lived  and so deirdre and her fostermother lived in the lonely place among the hills without the knowledge or the notice of any strange person until deirdre was fourteen years of age and deirdre grew straight and clean like a rush on the bog and she was comely beyond comparison of all the women of the world and her movements were like the swan on the wave or the deer on the hill she was the young girl of the    greatest beauty and of the gentlest nature of all the women of ireland  levarcham that had charge of her used to be giving deirdre every knowledge and skill that she had herself there was not a blade of grass growing from root or a bird singing in the wood or a star shining from heaven but deirdre had the name of it but there was one thing she would not have her know she would not let her have friendship with any living person of the rest of the world outside their own house  but one dark night of winter with black clouds overhead a hunter came walking the hills and it is what happened he missed the track of the hunt and lost his way and his comrades  and a heaviness came upon him and he lay down on the side of the green hillock by deirdres house he was weak with hunger and going and perished with cold and a deep sleep came upon him while he was lying there a dream came to the hunter and he thought that he was near the warmth of a house of the sidhe and the sidhe inside making music and he called out in his dream if there is any one inside let them bring me in in the name of the sun and the moon deirdre heard the voice and she said to levarcham mother mother what is that but levarcham said it is nothing that matters it is the birds of the air gone astray and trying to find one another but let them go back to the branches of the wood another troubled dream came on the hunter and he cried out a second time what is that asked deirdre again it is nothing that matters said levarcham the birds of the air are looking for one another let them go past to the branches of the wood then a third dream came to the hunter and he cried out a third time if there was any one in the hill to let him in for the sake of the elements for he was perished with cold and overcome with hunger oh    what is that levarcham said deirdre there is nothing there for you to see my child but only the birds of the air and they lost to one another but let them go past us to the branches of the wood there is no place or shelter for them here tonight oh mother said deirdre the bird asked to come in for the sake of the sun and the moon and it is what you yourself told me that anything that is asked like that it is right for us to give it if you will not let in the bird that is perished with cold and overcome with hunger i myself will let it in so deirdre rose up and drew the bolt from the leaf of the door and let in the hunter she put a seat in the place for sitting food in the place for eating and drink in the place for drinking for the man who had come into the house come now and eat food for you are in want of it said deirdre indeed it is i was in want of food and drink and warmth when i came into this house but by my word i have forgotten that since i saw yourself said the hunter how little you are able to curb your tongue said levarcham it is not a great thing for you to keep your tongue quiet when you get the shelter of a house and the warmth of a hearth on a dark winter night that is so said the hunter i may do that much to keep my mouth shut but i swear by the oath my people swear by if some others of the people of the world saw this great beauty that is hidden away here they would not leave her long with you what people are those said deirdre i will tell you that said the hunter they are naoise son of usnach and ainnle and ardan his two brothers what is the appearance of these men if we should ever see them said deirdre this is the appearance that is on those three men said the hunter: the colour of the raven is on their hair their skin is like the swan on the wave their cheeks like the blood of the speckled red calf and their swiftness and their leap are like the    salmon of the stream and like the deer of the grey mountain and the head and shoulders of naoise are above all the other men of ireland however they may be said levarcham get you out from here and take another road and by my word little is my thankfulness to yourself or to her that let you in you need not send him out for telling me that said deirdre for as to those three men i myself saw them last night in a dream and they hunting upon a hill  the hunter went away but in a little time after he began to think to himself how conchubar high king of ulster was used to lie down at night and to rise up in the morning by himself without a wife or any one to speak to and that if he could see this great beauty it was likely he would bring her home to emain and that he himself would get the goodwill of the king for telling him there was such a queen to be found on the face of the world  so he went straight to king conchubar at emain macha and he sent word into the king that he had news for him if he would hear it the king sent for him to come in what is the reason of your journey he said it is what i have to tell you king said the hunter that i have seen the greatest beauty that ever was born in ireland and i am come to tell you of it  who is this great beauty and in what place is she to be seen when she was never seen before you saw her if you did see her i did see her indeed said the hunter but no other man can see her unless he knows from me the place where she is living will you bring me to the place where she is and you will have a good reward said the king i will bring you there said the hunter let you stay with my household tonight said conchubar and i myself and my people will go with you early on the morning of tomorrow i will stay said the hunter and he    stayed that night in the household of king conchubar  then conchubar sent to fergus and to the other chief men of ulster and he told them of what he was about to do though it was early when the songs and the music of the birds began in the woods it was earlier yet when conchubar king of ulster rose with his little company of near friends in the fresh spring morning of the fresh and pleasant month of may and the dew was heavy on every bush and flower as they went out towards the green hill where deirdre was living  but many a young man of them that had a light glad leaping step when they set out had but a tired slow failing step before the end because of the length and the roughness of the way it is down there below said the hunter in the house in that valley the woman is living but i myself will not go nearer it than this  conchubar and his troop went down then to the green hillock where deirdre was and they knocked at the door of the house levarcham called out that neither answer nor opening would be given to any one at all and that she did not want disturbance put on herself or her house open said conchubar in the name of the high king of ulster when levarcham heard conchubars voice she knew there was no use trying to keep deirdre out of sight any longer and she rose up in haste and let in the king and as many of his people as could follow him  when the king saw deirdre before him he thought in himself that he never saw in the course of the day or in the dreams of the night a creature so beautiful and he gave her his full hearts weight of love there and then it is what he did he put deirdre up on the shoulders of his men and she herself and levarcham were brought away to emain macha    with the love that conchubar had for deirdre he wanted to marry her with no delay but when her leave was asked she would not give it for she was young yet and she had no knowledge of the duties of a wife or the ways of a kings house and when conchubar was pressing her hard she asked him to give her a delay of a year and a day he said he would give her that though it was hard for him if she would give him her certain promise to marry him at the years end she did that and conchubar got a woman teacher for her and nice fine pleasant modest maidens to be with her at her lying down and at her rising up to be companions to her and deirdre grew wise in the works of a young girl and in the understanding of a woman and if any one at all looked at her face whatever colour she was before that she would blush crimson red and it is what conchubar thought that he never saw with the eyes of his body a creature that pleased him so well  one day deirdre and her companions were out on a hill near emain macha looking around them in the pleasant sunshine and they saw three men walking together deirdre was looking at the men and wondering at them and when they came near she remembered the talk of the hunter and the three men she saw in her dream and she thought to herself that these were the three sons of usnach and that this was naoise that had his head and shoulders above all the men of ireland the three brothers went by without turning their eyes at all upon the young girls on the hillside and they were singing as they went and whoever heard the low singing of the sons of usnach it was enchantment and music to them and every cow that was being milked and heard it gave twothirds more of milk and it is what happened that love for naoise came into the heart of deirdre so that she could not but    follow him she gathered up her skirt and went after the three men that had gone past the foot of the hill leaving her companions there after her  but ainnle and ardan had heard talk of the young girl that was at conchubars court and it is what they thought that if naoise their brother would see her it is for himself he would have her for she was not yet married to the king so when they saw deidre coming after them they said to one another to hasten their steps for they had a long road to travel and the dusk of night coming on they did so and deirdre saw it and she cried out after them naoise son of usnach are you going to leave me what cry was that came to my ears that it is not well for me to answer and not easy for me to refuse said naoise it was nothing but the cry of conchubars wild ducks said his brothers but let us quicken our steps and hasten our feet for we have a long road to travel and the dusk of the evening coming on they did so and they were widening the distance between themselves and her then deirdre cried naoise naoise son of usnach are you going to leave me what cry was it that came to my ears and struck my heart that it is not well for me to answer or easy for me to refuse said naoise nothing but the cry of conchubars wild geese said his brothers but let us quicken our steps and hasten our feet the darkness of night is coming on they did so and were widening the distance between themselves and her then deirdre cried the third time naoise naoise naoise son of usnach are you going to leave me what sharp clear cry was that the sweetest that ever came to my ears and the sharpest that ever struck my heart of all the cries i ever heard said naoise what is it but the scream of conchubars lake swans said his brothers that was the third cry of some person beyond there said naoise and i    swear by my hand of valour he said i will go no further until i see where the cry comes from so naoise turned back and met deirdre and deirdre and naoise kissed one another three times and she gave a kiss to each of his brothers and with the confusion that was on her a blaze of red fire came upon her and her colour came and went as quickly as the aspen by the stream and it is what naoise thought to himself that he never saw a woman so beautiful in his life and he gave deirdre there and then the love that he never gave to living thing to vision or to creature but to herself alone  then he lifted her high on his shoulder and he said to his brothers to hasten their steps and they hastened them  harm will come of this said the young men although there should harm come said naoise i am willing to be in disgrace while i live we will go with her to another province and there is not in ireland a king who will not give us a welcome so they called their people and that night they set out with three times fifty men and three times fifty women and three times fifty greyhounds and deirdre in their midst  they were a long time after that shifting from one place to another all around ireland from esro in the south to beinn etair in the east again and it is often they were in danger of being destroyed by conchubars devices and one time the druids raised a wood before them but naoise and his brothers cut their way through it but at last they got out of ulster and sailed to the country of alban and settled in a lonely place and when hunting on the mountains failed them they fell upon the cattle of the men of alban so that these gathered together to make an end of them but the sons of usnach called to the king of scotland and he took them into his friendship and    they gave him their help when he went out into battles or to war  but all this time they had never spoken to the king of deirdre and they kept her with themselves not to let any one see her for they were afraid they might get their death on account of her she being so beautiful  but it chanced very early one morning the kings steward came to visit them and he found his way into the house where naoise and deirdre were and there he saw them asleep beside one another he went back then to the king and he said: up to this time there has never been found a woman that would be a fitting wife for you but there is a woman on the shore of loch ness now is well worthy of you king of the east and what you have to do is to make an end of naoise for it is of his wife i am speaking i will not do that said the king but go to her he said and bid her to come and see me secretly the steward brought her that message but deirdre sent him away and all that he had said to her she told it to naoise afterwards then when she would not come to him the king sent the sons of usnach into every hard fight hoping they would get their death but they won every battle and came back safe again and after a while they went to loch eitche near the sea and they were left to themselves there for a while in peace and quietness and they settled and made a dwelling house for themselves by the side of loch ness and they could kill the salmon of the stream from out their own door and the deer of the grey hills from out their window but when naoise went to the court of the king his clothes were splendid among the great men of the army of scotland a cloak of bright purple rightly shaped with a fringe of bright gold a coat of satin with fifty hooks of silver a brooch on which were a hundred polished gems a goldhilted sword in    his hand two bluegreen spears of bright points a dagger with the colour of yellow gold on it and a hilt of silver but the two children they had gaiar and aebgreine they gave into the care of manannan son of the sea and he cared them well in emhain of the apple trees and he brought bobaras the poet to give learning to gaiar and aebgreine of the sunny face he gave in marriage afterwards to rinn son of eochaidh juil of the land of promise     now it happened after a time that a very great feast was made by conchubar in emain macha for all the great among his nobles so that the whole company were easy and pleasant together the musicians stood up to play their songs and to give poems and they gave out the branches of relationship and of kindred these are the names of the poets that were in emain at the time cathbad the druid son of conall son of rudraige geanann of the bright face son of cathbad ferceirtne and geanann blackknee and many others and sencha son of ailell  they were all drinking and making merry until conchubar the king raised his voice and spoke aloud and it is what he said: i desire to know from you did you ever see a better house than this house of emain or a hearth better than my hearth in any place you were ever in we did not they said if that is so said conchubar do you know of anything at all that is wanting to you we know of nothing said they that is not so with me said conchubar i know of a great want that is on you the want of the three best candles of the gael the three noble sons of usnach that ought not to be away from us for the sake of any woman in the world naoise ainnle and ardan for surely they are the sons of a king and    they would defend the high kingship against the best men of ireland if we had dared said they it is long ago we would have said it and more than that the province of ulster would be equal to any other province in ireland if there was no ulsterman in it but those three alone for it is lions they are in hardness and in bravery if that is so said conchubar let us send word by a messenger to alban and to the dwellingplace of the sons of usnach to ask them back again who will go there with the message said they all i cannot know that said conchubar for there is geasa that is bonds on naoise not to come back with any man only one of the three conall cearnach or fergus or cuchulain and i will know now said he which one of those three loves me best then he called conall to one side and he asked him what would you do with me if i should send you for the sons of usnach and if they were destroyed through mea thing i do not mean to do as i am not going to undertake it said conall i will say that it is not one alone i would kill but any ulsterman i would lay hold of that had harmed them would get shortening of life from me and the sorrow of death i see well said conchubar you are no friend of mine and he put conall away from him then he called cuchulain to him and asked him the same as he did the other i give my word as i am not going said cuchulain if you want that of me and that you think to kill them when they come it is not one person alone that would die for it but every ulsterman i could lay hold of would get shortening of life from me and the sorrow of death i see well said conchubar that you are no friend of mine and he put cuchulain from him and then he called fergus to him and asked him the same question and fergus said whatever may happen i promise your    blood will be safe from me but besides yourself there is no ulsterman that would try to harm them and that i would lay hold of but i would give him shortening of life and the sorrow of death i see well said conchubar it is yourself must go for them and it is tomorrow you must set out for it is with you they will come and when you are coming back to us westward i put you under bonds to go first to the fort of borach son of cainte and give me your word now that as soon as you get there you will send on the sons of usnach to emain whether it be day or night at the time after that the two of them went in together and fergus told all the company how it was under his charge they were to be put  then conchubar went to borach and asked had he a feast ready prepared for him i have said borach but although i was able to make it ready i was not able to bring it to emain if that is so said conchubar give it to fergus when he comes back to ireland for it is geasa on him not to refuse your feast borach promised he would do that and so they wore away that night  so fergus set out in the morning and he brought no guard nor helpers with him but himself and his two sons fairhaired iollan and roughred buinne and cuillean the shieldbearer and the shield itself they went on till they got to the dwellingplace of the sons of usnach and to loch eitche in alba it is how the sons of usnach lived they had three houses and the house where they made ready the food it is not there they would eat it and the house where they would eat it it is not there they would sleep  when fergus came to the harbour he let a great shout out of him and it is how naoise and deirdre were they had a chessboard between them and they playing on it naoise heard the shout and he said    paragraph continues that is the shout of a man of ireland it is not but the cry of a man of alban said deirdre she knew at the first it was fergus gave the shout but she denied it then fergus let another shout out of him that is an irish shout said naoise again it is not indeed said deirdre let us go on playing then fergus gave the third shout and the sons of usnach knew this time it was the shout of fergus and naoise said to ardan to go out and meet him then deirdre told him that she herself knew at the first shout that it was fergus why did you deny it then queen said naoise because of a vision i saw last night said deirdre three birds i saw coming to us from emain macha and three drops of honey in their mouths and they left them with us and three drops of our blood they brought away with them what meaning do you put on that queen said naoise it is said deirdre fergus that is coming to us with a message of peace from conchubar for honey is not sweeter than a message of peace sent by a lying man let that pass said naoise is there anything in it but troubled sleep and the melancholy of woman and it is a long time fergus is in the harbour rise up ardan to be before him and bring him with you here and ardan went down to meet him and gave a fond kiss to himself and to his two sons and it is what he said: my love to you dear comrades after that he asked news of ireland and they gave it to him and then they came to where naoise and ainnle and deirdre were and they kissed fergus and his two sons and they asked news of ireland from them it is the best news i have for you said fergus that conchubar king of ulster has sworn by the earth beneath him by the high heaven above him and by the sun that travels to the west that he will have no rest by day nor sleep by    night if the sons of usnach his own fosterbrothers will not come back to the land of their home and the country of their birth and he has sent us to ask you there it is better for them to stop here said deirdre for they have a greater sway in scotland than conchubar himself has in ireland ones own country is better than any other thing said fergus for no man can have any pleasure however great his good luck and his way of living if he does not see his own country every day that is true said naoise for ireland is dearer to myself than alban though i would get more in alban than in ireland it will be safe for you to come with me said fergus it will be safe indeed said naoise and we will go with you to ireland and though there were no trouble beneath the sun but a man to be far from his own land there is little delight in peace and a long sleep to a man that is an exile it is a pity for the man that is an exile it is little his honour it is great his grief for it is he will have his share of wandering  it was not with deirdres will naoise said that and she was greatly against going with fergus and she said: i had a dream last night of the three sons of usnach and they bound and put in the grave by conchubar of the red branch but naoise said: lay down your dream deirdre on the heights of the hills lay down your dream on the sailors of the sea lay down your dream on the rough grey stones for we will give peace and we will get it from the king of the world and from conchubar but deirdre spoke again and it is what she said: there is the howling of dogs in my ears a vision of the night is before my eyes i see fergus away from us i see conchubar without mercy in his dun i see naoise without strength in battle i see ainnle without his loudsounding shield i see ardan without shield or breastplate and the hill    of atha without delight i see conchubar asking for blood i see fergus caught with hidden lies i see deirdre crying with tears i see deirdre crying with tears  a thing that is unpleasing to me and that i would never give in to said fergus is to listen to the howling of dogs and to the dreams of women and since conchubar the high king has sent a message of friendship it would not be right for you to refuse it it would not be right indeed said naoise and we will go with you tomorrow and fergus gave his word and he said if all the men of ireland were against you it would not profit them for neither shield nor sword or a helmet itself would be any help or protection to them against you and i myself to be with you that is true said naoise and we will go with you to ireland  they spent the night there until morning and then they went where the ships were and they went on the sea and a good many of their people with them and deirdre looked back on the land of alban and it is what she said: my love to you o land to the east and it goes ill with me to leave you for it is pleasant are your bays and your harbours and your wide flowery plains and your greensided hills and little need was there for us to leave you and she made this complaint: dear to me is that land that land to the east alban with its wonders i would not have come from it hither but that i came with naoise  dear to me dun fiodhaigh and dun fionn dear is the dun above them dear to me inis droignach dear to me dun suibhne  o coill cuan ohone coill cuan where ainnle used to come my grief it was short i thought his stay there with naoise in western alban glen laoi o glen laoi where i used to sleep under soft coverings    fish and venison and badgers flesh that was my portion in glen laoi  glen masan my grief glen masan high its hartstongue bright its stalks we were rocked to pleasant sleep over the wooded harbour of masan  glen archan my grief glen archan the straight valley of the pleasant ridge never was there a young man more lighthearted than my naoise used to be in glen archan  glen eitche my grief glen eitche it was there i built my first house beautiful were the woods on our rising the home of the sun is glen eitche  glendarua my grief glendarua my love to every man that belongs to it sweet is the voice of the cuckoo on the bending branch on the hill above glendarua  dear to me is droighin over the fierce strand dear are its waters over the clean sand i would never have come out from it at all but that i came with my beloved  after she had made that complaint they came to dun borach and borach gave three fond kisses to fergus and to the sons of usnach along with him it was then borach said he had a feast laid out for fergus and that it was geasa for him to leave it until he would have eaten it but fergus reddened with anger from head to foot and it is what he said: it is a bad thing you have done borach laying out a feast for me and conchubar to have made me give my word that as soon as i would come to ireland whether it would be by day or in the nighttime i would send on the sons of usnach to emain macha i hold you under geasa said borach to stop and use the feast  then fergus asked naoise what should he do about the feast you must choose said deirdre whether you will forsake the children of usnach or the feast and    it would be better for you to refuse the feast than to forsake the sons of usnach i will not forsake them said he for i will send my two sons fairhaired iollan and roughred buinne with them to emain macha on my word said naoise that is a great deal to do for us for up to this no other person ever protected us but ourselves and he went out of the place in great anger and ainnle and ardan and deirdre and the two sons of fergus followed him and they left fergus dark and sorrowful after them but for all that fergus was full sure that if all the provinces of ireland would go into one council they would not consent to break the pledge he had given  as for the sons of usnach they went on their way by every short road and deirdre said to them i will give you a good advice sons of usnach though you may not follow it what is that advice queen said naoise it is said she to go to rechrainn between ireland and scotland and to wait there until fergus has done with the feast and that will be the keeping of his word to fergus and it will be the lengthening of your lives to you we will not follow that advice said naoise and the children of fergus said it was little trust she had in them when she thought they would not protect her though their hands might not be so strong as the hands of the sons of usnach and besides that fergus had given them his word alas it is sorrow came on us with the word of fergus said deirdre and he to forsake us for a feast and she made this complaint: it is grief to me that ever i came from the east on the word of the unthinking son of rogh it is only lamentations i will make och it is very sorrowful my heart is  my heart is heaped up with sorrow it is tonight my great hurt is my grief my dear companions the end of your days is come    and it is what naoise answered her: do not say that in your haste deirdre more beautiful than the sun fergus would never have come for us eastward to bring us back to be destroyed  and deirdre said my grief i think it too far for you beautiful sons of usnach to have come from alban of the rough grass it is lasting will be its lifelong sorrow  after that they went forward to finncairn of the watchtower on sharppeaked slieve fuad and deirdre stayed after them in the valley and sleep fell on her there  when naoise saw that deirdre was left after them he turned back as she was rising out of her sleep and he said what made you wait after us queen sleep that was on me said deirdre and i saw a vision in it what vision was that said naoise it was she said fairhaired iollan that i saw without his head on him and roughred buinne with his head on him and it is without help of roughred buinne you were and it is with the help of fairhaired iollan you were and she made this complaint:  it is a sad vision has been shown to me of my four tall fair bright companions the head of each has been taken from him and no help to be had one from another  but when naoise heard this he reproached her and said o fair beautiful woman nothing does your mouth speak but evil do not let the sharpness and the great misfortune that come from it fall on your friends and deirdre answered him with kind gentle words and it is what she said: it would be better to me to see harm come on any other person than upon any one of you three with whom i have travelled over the seas and over the wide plains but when i look on you it is only buinne i can see safe and untouched    and i know by that his life will be longest among you and indeed it is i that am sorrowful tonight  after that they came forward to the high willows and it was then deirdre said i see a cloud in the air and it is a cloud of blood and i would give you a good advice sons of usnach she said what is that advice said naoise to go to dundealgan where cuchulain is until fergus has done with the feast and to be under the protection of cuchulain for fear of the treachery of conchubar since there is no fear on us we will not follow that advice said naoise and deirdre complained and it is what she said: o naoise look at the cloud i see above us in the air i see a cloud over green macha cold and deep red like blood i am startled by the cloud that i see here in the air a thin dreadful cloud that is like a clot of blood i give a right advice to the beautiful sons of usnach not to go to emain tonight because of the danger that is over them  we will go to dundealgan where the hound of the smith is we will come tomorrow from the south along with the hound cuchulain  but naoise said in his anger to deirdre since there is no fear on us we will not follow your advice and deirdre turned to the grandsons of rogh and it is what she said: it is seldom until now naoise that yourself and myself were not of the one mind and i say to you naoise that you would not have gone against me like this the day manannan gave me the cup in the time of his great victory  after that they went on to emain macha sons of usnach said deirdre i have a sign by which you will know if conchubar is going to do treachery on you what sign is that said naoise if you are let come into the house where conchubar is and the nobles of ulster then conchubar is not going to do treachery    on you but if it is in the house of the red branch you are put then he is going to do treachery on you  after that they came to emain macha and they took the handwood and struck the door and the doorkeeper asked who was there they told him that it was the sons of usnach and deirdre and the two sons of fergus were there  when conchubar heard that he called his stewards and serving men to him and he asked them how was the house of the red branch for food and for drink they said that if all the seven armies of ulster would come there they would find what would satisfy them if that is so said conchubar bring the sons of usnach into it  it was then deirdre said it would have been better for you to follow my advice and never to have come to emain and it would be right for you to leave it even at this time we will not said fairhaired iollan for it is not fear or cowardliness was ever seen on us but we will go to the house so they went on to the house of the red branch and the stewards and the servingmen with them and welltasting food was served to them and pleasant drinks till they were all glad and merry except only deirdre and the sons of usnach for they did not use much food or drink because of the length and the greatness of their journey from dun borsch to emain macha then naoise said give the chessboard to us till we go playing so they gave them the chessboard and they began to play  it was just at that time conchubar was asking who will i send that will bring me word of deirdre and that will tell me if she has the same appearance and the same shape she had before for if she has there is not a woman in the world has a more beautiful shape or appearance than she has and i will bring her out with edge of blade and point of sword in spite of the    sons of usnach good though they be but if not let naoise have her for himself i myself will go there said levarcham and i will bring you word of that and it is how it was deirdre was dearer to her than any other person in the world for it was often she went through the world looking for deirdre and bringing news to her and from her so levarcham went over to the house of the red branch and near it she saw a great troop of armed men and she spoke to them but they made her no answer and she knew by that it was none of the men of ulster were in it but men from some strange country that conchubars messengers had brought to emain  and then she went in where naoise and deirdre were and it is how she found them the polished chessboard between them and they playing on it and she gave them fond kisses and she said:  you are not doing well to be playing and it is to bring conchubar word if deirdre has the same shape and appearance she used to have that he sent me here now and there is grief on me for the deed that will be done in emain tonight treachery that will be done and the killing of kindred and the three bright candles of the gael to be quenched and emain will not be the better of it to the end of life and time and she made this complaint sadly and wearily:  sad is my heart for the treachery that is being done in emain this night on account of this treachery emain will never be at peace from this out  the three that are most kinglike today under the sun the three best of all that live on the earth it is grief to me tonight they to die for the sake of any woman naoise and ainnle whose deeds are known and ardan their brother treachery is to be done on the young brightfaced three it is not i that am not sorrowful tonight    when she had made this complaint levarcham said to the sons of usnach and to the children of fergus to shut close the doors and the windows of the house and to do bravery and oh sons of fergus she said defend your charge and your care bravely till fergus comes and you will have praise and a blessing for it and she cried with many tears and she went back to where conchubar was and he asked news of deirdre of her and levarcham said it is good news and bad news i have for you what news is that said conchubar it is the good news she said the three sons of usnach to have come to you and to be over there and they are the three that are bravest and mightiest in form and in looks and in countenance of all in the world and ireland will be yours from this out since the sons of usnach are with you and the news that is worst with me is the woman that was best of the women of the world in form and in looks going out of emain is without the form and without the appearance she used to have  when conchubar heard that much of his jealousy went backward and he was drinking and making merry for a while until he thought on deirdre again the second time and on that he asked who will i get to bring me word of deirdre but he did not find any one would go there and then he said to gelban the merry pleasant son of the king of lochlann: go over and bring me word if deirdre has the same shape and the same appearance she used to have for if she has there is not on the ridge of the world or on the waves of the earth a woman more beautiful than herself  so gelban went to the house of the red branch and he found the doors and the windows of the fort shut and fear came on him and it is what he said: it is not an easy road for any one that would get to the sons of usnach for i think there is very great    anger on them and after that he found a window that was left open by forgetfulness in the house and he was looking in then deirdre saw him through the window and when she saw him looking at her she went into a red blaze of blushes and naoise knew that some one was looking at her from the window and she told him that she saw a young man looking in at them it is how naoise was at that time with a man of the chessmen in his hand and he made a fair throw over his shoulder at the young man that put the eye out of his head the young man went back to where conchubar was you were merry and pleasant going out said conchubar but you are sad and cheerless coming back and then gelban told him the story from beginning to end i see well said conchubar the man that made that throw will be king of the world unless he has his life shortened and what appearance is there on deirdre he said it is this said gelban although naoise put out my eye i would have wished to stay there looking at her with the other eye but for the haste you put on me for there is not in the world a woman is better of shape or of form than herself  when conchubar heard that he was filled with jealousy and with envy and he bade the men of his army that were with him and that had been drinking at the feast to go and attack the place where the sons of usnach were so they went forward to the house of the red branch and they gave three great shouts around it and they put fires and red flames to it when the sons of usnach heard the shouts they asked who those men were that were about the house conchubar and the men of ulster they all said together it is the pledge of fergus you would break said fairhaired iollan on my word said conchubar there will be sorrow on the sons of usnach deirdre to be with them that is true    said deirdre fergus had deceived you by my oath said roughred buinne if he betrayed we will not betray it was then buinne went out and killed threefifths of the fighting men outside and put great disturbance on the rest and conchubar asked who was there and who was doing destruction on his men like that it is i myself roughred buinne son of fergus said he i will give you a good gift if you will leave off said conchubar what gift is that said roughred buinne a hundred of land said conchubar what besides said roughred buinne my own friendship and my counsel said conchubar i will take that said roughred buinne it was a good mountain that was given him as a reward but it turned barren in the same night and no green grew on it again for ever and it used to be called the mountain of the share of buinne  deirdre heard what they were saying by my word she said roughred buinne has forsaken you and in my opinion it is like the father the son is i give my word says fairhaired iollan that is not so with me as long as this narrow straight sword stays in my hand i will not forsake the sons of usnach  after that fairhaired iollan went out and made three courses around the house and killed threefifths of heroes outside and he came in again where naoise was and he playing chess and ainnle with him so iollan went out the second time and made three other courses round the fort and he brought a lighted torch with him on the lawn and he went destroying the hosts so that they dared not come to attack the house and he was a good son fairhaired iollan for he never refused any person on the ridge of the world anything that he had and he never took wages from any person but only fergus    it was then conchubar said: what place is my own son fiacra the fair i am here high prince said fiacra by my word said conchubar it is on the one night yourself and iollan were born and as it is the aims of his father he has with him let you take my arms with you that is my shield the ochain my two spears and my great sword the gorm glas the blue greenand do bravery and great deeds with them  then fiacra took conchubars arms and he and fairhaired iollan attacked one another and they made a stout fight one against the other but however it was fairhaired iollan put down fiacra so that he made him lie under the shelter of his shield till it roared for the greatness of the strait he was in for it was the way with the ochain the shield of conchubar to roar when the person on whom it would be was in danger and the three chief waves of ireland the wave of tuagh the wave of cliodna and the wave of rudraige roared in answer to it  it was at that time conall cearnach was at dun sobairce and he heard the wave of tuagh true it is said conall conchubar is in some danger and it is not right for me to be here listening to him  conall rose up on that and he put his arms and his armour on him and came forward to where conchubar was at emain macha and he found the fight going on on the lawn and fiacra the son of conchubar greatly pressed by fairhaired iollan and neither the king of ulster nor any other person dared to go between them but conall went aside behind fairhaired iollan and thrust his sword through him who is it has wounded me behind my back said fairhaired iollan whoever did it by my hand of valour he would have got a fair fight face to face from myself who are you yourself said conall i am iollan son of    fergus and are you yourself conall it is i said conall it is evil and it is heavy the work you have done said iollan and the sons of usnach under my protection is that true said conall it is true indeed said iollan by my hand of valour said conall conchubar will not get his own son alive from me to avenge it and he gave a stroke of the sword to fiacra so that he struck his head off and he left them so the clouds of death came upon fairhaired iollan then and he threw his arms towards the fortress and called out to naoise to do bravery and after that he died  it is then conchubar himself came out and nineteen hundred men with him and conall said to him: go up now to the doorway of the fort and see where your sisters children are lying on a bed of trouble and when conchubar saw them he said: you are not sisters children to me it is not the deed of sisters children you have done me but you have done harm to me with treachery in the sight of all the men of ireland and it is what ainnle said to him: although we took wellshaped softhanded deirdre from you yet we did a little kindness to you at another time and this is the time to remember it that day your ship was breaking up on the sea and it full of gold and silver we gave you up our own ship and ourselves went swimming to the harbour but conchubar said: if you did fifty good deeds to me surely this would be my thanks i would not give you peace and you in distress but every great want i could put on you  and then ardan said: we did another little kindness to you and this is the time to remember it the day the speckled horse failed you on the green of dundealgan it was we gave you the grey horse that would bring you fast on your road  but conchubar said: if you had done fifty good    deeds to me surely this would be my thanks i would not give you peace and you in distress but every great want i could put on you  and then naoise said: we did you another good deed and this is the time to remember it we have put you under many benefits it is strong our right is to your protection  the time when murcael son of brian fought the seven battles at beinn etair we brought you without fail the heads of the sons of the king of the southeast  but conchubar said: if you had done me fifty good deeds surely this is my thanks i would not give you peace in your distress but every great want i could put upon you  your death is not a death to me now young sons of usnach since he that was innocent fell by you the third best of the horsemen of ireland  then deirdre said: rise up naoise take your sword good son of a king mind yourself well for it is not long that life will be left in your fair body  it is then all conchubars men came about the house and they put fires and burning to it ardan went out then and his men and put out the fires and killed three hundred men and ainnle went out in the third part of the night and he killed three hundred and did slaughter and destruction on them  and naoise went out in the last quarter of the night and drove away all the army from the house  he came into the house after that and it is then deirdre rose up and said to him: by my word it is well you won your way and do bravery and valour from this out and it was bad advice you took when you ever trusted conchubar  as for the sons of usnach after that they made a good protection with their shields and they put deirdre in the    middle and linked the shields around her and they gave three leaps out over the walls of emain and they killed three hundred men in that sally  when conchubar saw that he went to cathbad the druid and said to him: go cathbad to the sons of usnach and work enchantment on them for unless they are hindered they will destroy the men of ulster for ever if they go away in spite of them and i give the word of a true hero they will get no harm from me but let them only make agreement with me when cathbad heard that he agreed believing him and he went to the end of his arts and his knowledge to hinder the sons of usnach and he worked enchantment on them so that he put the likeness of a dark sea about them with hindering waves and when naoise saw the waves rising he put up deirdre on his shoulder and it is how the sons of usnach were swimming on the ground as they were going out of emain yet the men of ulster did not dare to come near them until their swords had fallen from their hands but after their swords fell from their hands the sons of usnach were taken and when they were taken conchubar asked of the children of durthacht to kill them but the children of durthacht said they would not do that there was a young man with conchubar whose name was maine and his surname roughhand son of the king of the fair norwegians and it is naoise had killed his father and his two brothers athrac and triathrach were their names and he said he himself would kill the sons of usnach if that is so said ardan kill me the first for i am younger than my brothers so that i will not see my brothers killed let him not be killed but myself said ainnle let that not be done said naoise for i have a sword that manannan son of lir gave me and the stroke of it leaves nothing after it track nor trace and strike the three of us together and we will die at the    one time that is well said they all and let you lay down your heads they said they did that and maine gave a strong quick blow of the sword on the three necks together on the block and struck the three heads off them with one stroke and the men of ulster gave three loud sorrowful shouts and cried aloud about them there  as for deirdre she cried pitifully wearily and tore her fair hair and she was talking on the sons of usnach and on alban and it is what she said:  a blessing eastward to alban from me good is the sight of her bays and valleys pleasant was it to sit on the slopes of her hills where the sons of usnach used to be hunting  one day when the nobles of scotland were drinking with the sons of usnach to whom they owed their affection naoise gave a kiss secretly to the daughter of the lord of duntreon he sent her a frightened deer wild and a fawn at its foot and he went to visit her coming home from the host of inverness when myself heard that my head filled full of jealousy i put my boat on the waves it was the same to me to live or to die they followed me swimming ainnle and ardan that never said a lie they turned me back again two that would give battle to a hundred naoise gave me his true word he swore three times with his arms as witness he would never put vexation on me again until he would go from me to the hosts of the dead  och if she knew tonight naoise to be under a covering of clay it is she would cry her fill and it is i would cry along with her  after she had made this complaint seeing they were all taken up with one another deirdre came forward on the lawn and she was running round and round up and down from one to another and cuchulain met    her and she told him the story from first to last how it had happened to the sons of usnach it is sorrowful cuchulain was for that for there was not in the world a man was dearer to him than naoise and he asked who killed him maine rough hand said deirdre then cuchulain went away sad and sorrowful to dundealgan  after that deirdre lay down by the grave and they were digging earth from it and she made this lament after the sons of usnach:  long is the day without the sons of usnach it was never wearisome to be in their company sons of a king that entertained exiles three lions of the hill of the cave  three darlings of the women of britain three hawks of slieve cuilenn sons of a king served by valour to whom warriors did obedience the three mighty bears three lions of the fort of conrach three sons of a king who thought well of their praise three nurslings of the men of ulster  three heroes not good at homage their fall is a cause of sorrow three sons of the sister of a king three props of the army of cuailgne  three dragons of dun monad the three valiant men from the red branch i myself will not be living after them the three that broke hard battles  three that were brought up by aoife to whom lands were under tribute three pillars in the breach of battle three pupils that were with scathach  three pupils that were with uathach three champions that were lasting in might three shining sons of usnach it is weariness to be without them  the high king of ulster my first betrothed i forsook for love of naoise short my life will be after him i will make keening at their burial    that i would live after naoise let no one think on the earth i will not go on living after ainnle and after ardan  after them i myself will not live three that would leap through the midst of battle since my beloved is gone from me i will cry my fill over his grave  o young man digging the new grave do not make the grave narrow i will be along with them in the grave making lamentation and ochones  many the hardship i met with along with the three heroes i suffered want of house want of fire it is myself that used not to be troubled  their three shields and their spears made a bed for me often o young man put their three swords close over their grave  there three hounds their three hawks will be from this time without huntsmen three helpers of every battle three pupils of conan cearnach  the three leashes of those three hounds have brought a sigh from my heart it is i had the care of them the sight of them is a cause of grief  i was never one day alone to the day of the making of this grave though it is often that myself and yourselves were in loneliness  my sight is gone from me with looking at the grave of naoise it is short till my life will leave me and those who would have keened me do not live  since it is through me they were betrayed i will be tired out with sorrow it is a pity i was not in the earth before the sons of usnach were killed  sorrowful was my journey with fergus betraying me to the red branch we were deceived all together with his sweet flowery words i left the delights of ulster for the three heroes that were bravest my life will not be long i myself am alone after them    i am deirdre without gladness and i at the end of my life since it is grief to be without them i myself will not be long after them  after that complaint deirdre loosed out her hair and threw herself on the body of naoise before it was put in the grave and gave three kisses to him and when her mouth touched his blood the colour of burning sods came into her cheeks and she rose up like one that had lost her wits and she went on through the night till she came to where the waves were breaking on the strand and a fisherman was there and his wife and they brought her into their cabin and sheltered her and she neither smiled nor laughed nor took food drink or sleep nor raised her head from her knees but crying always after the sons of usnach  but when she could not be found at emain conchubar sent levarcham to look for her and to bring her back to his palace that he might make her his wife and levarcham found her in the fishermans cabin and she bade her come back to emain where she would have protection and riches and all that she would ask and she gave her this message she brought from conchubar: come up to my house o branch with the dark eyelashes and there need be no fear on your fair face of hatred or of jealousy or of reproach and deirdre said: i will not go up to his house for it is not land or earth or food i am wanting or gold or silver or horses but leave to go to the grave where the sons of usnach are lying till i give the three honey kisses to their three white beautiful bodies and she made this complaint:  make keening for the heroes that were killed on their coming to ireland stately they used to be coming to the house the three great sons of usnach  the sons of usnach fell in the fight like three branches that were growing straight and nice and they    destroyed in a heavy storm that left neither bud nor twig of them  naoise my gentle welllearned comrade make no delay in crying him with me cry for ardan that killed the wild boars cry for ainnle whose strength was great  it was naoise that would kiss my lips my first man and my first sweetheart it was ainnle would pour out my drink and it was ardan would lay my pillow  though sweet to you is the mead that is drunk by the softliving son of ness the food of the sons of usnach was sweeter to me all through my lifetime  whenever naoise would go out to hunt through the woods or the wide plains all the meat he would bring back was better to me than honey  though sweet to you are the sounds of pipes and of trumpets it is truly i say to the king i have heard music that is sweeter  delightful to conchubar the king are pipes and trumpets but the singing of the sons of usnach was more delightful to me  it was naoise had the deep sound of the waves in his voice it was the song of ardan that was good and the voice of ainnle towards their green dwellingplace  their birth was beautiful and their blossoming as they grew to the strength of manhood sad is the end tothy the sons of usnach to be cut down  dear were their pleasant words dear their young high strength in their going through the plains of ireland there was a welcome before the coming of their strength  dear their grey eyes that were loved by women many looked on them as they went when they went freely searching through the woods their steps were pleasant on the dark mountain    i do not sleep at any time and the colour is gone from my face there is no sound can give me delight since the sons of usnach do not come  i do not sleep through the night my senses are scattered away from me i do not care for food or drink i have no welcome today for the pleasant drink of nobles or ease or comfort or delight or a great house or the palace of a king  do not break the strings of my heart as you took hold of my young youth conchubar though my darling is dead my love is strong to live what is country to me or land or lordship what are swift horses what are jewels and gold och it is i will be lying tonight on the strand like the beautiful sons of usnach  so levarcham went back to conchubar to tell him what way deirdre was and that she would not come with her to emain macha  and when she was gone deirdre went out on the strand and she found a carpenter making an oar for a boat and making a mast for it clean and straight to put up a sail to the wind and when she saw him making it she said: it is a sharp knife you have to cut the oar so clean and so straight and if you will give it to me she said i will give you a ring of the best gold in ireland for it the ring that belonged to naoise and that was with him through the battle and through the fight he thought much of it in his lifetime it is pure gold through and through so the carpenter took the in his hand and the knife in the other hand and he looked at them together and he gave her the knife for the ring and for her asking and her tears then deirdre went close to the waves and she said: since the other is not with me now i will spend no more of my lifetime without him and with that she drove the black knife into    her side but she drew it out again and threw it in the sea to her right hand the way no one would be blamed for her death  then conchubar came down to the strand and five hundred men along with him to bring deirdre away to emain macha but all he found before him was her white body on the ground and it without life and it is what he said:  a thousand deaths on the time i brought death on my sisters children now i am myself without deirdre and they themselves are without life  they were my sisters children the three brothers i vexed with blows naoise and ainnle and ardan they have died along with deirdre  and they took her white beautiful body and laid it in a grave and a flagstone was raised over her grave and over the grave of the sons of usnach and their names were written in ogham and keening was made for their burial  and as to fergus son of rogh he came on the day after the children of usnach were killed to emain macha and when he found they had been killed and his pledge to them broken he himself and cormac conloingeas conchubars own son and dubthach the beetle of ulster with their men made an attack on conchubars house and men and a great many were killed by them and emain macha was burned and destroyed  and after doing that they went into connaught to ailell and to maeve at cruachan and they were made welcome there and they took service with them and fought with them against ulster because of the treachery that was done by conchubar and that is the way fergus and the others came to be on the side of the men of connaught in the war for the brown bull of cuailgne    and cathbad laid a curse on emain macha on account of that great wrong and it is what he said that none of the race of conchubar should have the kingdom to the end of life and time  and that came true for the most of conchubars sons died in his own lifetime and when he was near his death he bade the men of ulster bring back cormac conloingeas out of cruachan and give him the kingdom  so they sent messengers to cormac and he set out and his three troops of men with him and he left his blessing with ailell and with maeve and he promised them a good return for all the kind treatment they had given him and they crossed the river at athluain and there they saw a red woman at the edge of the ford and she washing her chariot and her harness and after that they met a young girl coming towards them and a light green cloak about her and a brooch of precious stones at her breast and cormac asked her was she coming with them and she said she was not and it would be better for himself to turn back for the ruin of his life was come  and he stopped for the night at the house of the two smiths on the hill of bruighean mor the great dwellingplace  but a troop of the men of connaught came about the house in the night for they were on the way home after destroying and robbing a district of ulster and they thought to make an end of cormac before he would get to emain  and it chanced there was a great harper craiftine living close by and his wife sceanb daughter of scethern a druid of connaught loved cormac conloingeas and three times she had gone to meet him at athluain and she planted three trees theregrief and dark and dumbness    and there was great hatred and jealousy of cormac on craiftine so when he knew the men of connaught were going to make an attack on him he went outside the house with his harp and played a soft sleepy tune to him the way he had not the strength to rouse himself up and himself and the most of his people were killed and amergin that had gone with the message to him made his grave and his mound and the place is called cluain duma the lawn of the mound
