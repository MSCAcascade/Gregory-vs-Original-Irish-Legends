death of cuchulain  cuchulain went on then to the house of his mother dechtire to bid her farewell and she came out on the lawn to meet him for she knew well he was going out to face the men of ireland and she brought out wine in a vessel to him as her custom was when he passed that way but when he took the vessel in his hand it was red blood that was in it my grief he said my mother dechtire it is no wonder others to forsake me when you yourself offer me a drink of blood then she filled the vessel a second and a third tune and each time when she gave it to him there was nothing in it but blood  then anger came on cuchulain and he dashed the vessel against a rock and broke it and he said: the fault is not in yourself my mother dechtire but my luck is turned against me and my life is near its end and i will not come back alive this time from facing the men of ireland then dechtire tried hard to persuade him to go back and to wait till he would have the help of conall i will not wait he said for anything you can say for i would not give up my great name and my courage for all the riches of the world and from the day i first took arms till this day i have never drawn back from a fight or a battle and it is not now i will begin to draw back he said for a great name outlasts life    then he went on his way and cathbad that had followed him went with him and presently they came to a ford and there they saw a young girl thin and whiteskinned and having yellow hair washing and ever washing and wringing out clothing that was stained crimson red and she crying and keening all the time little hound said cathbad do you see what it is that young girl is doing it is your red clothes she is washing and crying as she washes because she knows you are going to your death against maeves great army and take the warning now and turn back again dear master said cuchulain you have followed me far enough for i will not turn back from my vengeance on the men of ireland that are come to burn and to destroy my house and my country and what is it to me the woman of the sidhe to be washing red clothing for me it is not long till there will be clothing enough and armour and aims lying soaked in pools of blood by my own sword and my spear and if you are sorry and loth to let me go into the fight i am glad and ready enough myself to go into it though i know as well as you yourself i must fall in it do not be hindering me any more then he said for if i stay or if i go death will meet me all the same but go now to emain to conchubar and to emer and bring them life and health from me for i will never go back to meet them again it is my grief and my wound i to part from them and o laeg he said we are going away under trouble and under darkness from emer now as it is often we came back to her with gladness out of strange places and far countries  then cathbad left him and he went on his way and after a while he saw three hags and they blind of the left eye before him in the mad and they having a venomous hound they were cooking with charms on rods    of the rowan tree and he was going by them for he knew it was not for his good they were there  but one of the hags called to him: stop a while with us cuchulain i will not stop with you said cuchulain that is because we have nothing better than a dog to give you said the hag if we had a grand big cookinghearth you would stop and visit us but because it is only a little we have to offer you you will not stop but he that will not show respect for the small though he is great he will get no respect himself  then he went over to her and she gave him the shoulderblade of the hound out of her left hand and he ate it out of his left hand and he put it down on his left thigh and the hand that took it was struck down and the thigh he put it on was struck through and through so that the strength that was in them before left them  then he went dawn the road of meadhonluachair by slieve fuad and his enemy erc son of cairbre saw him in the chariot and his sword shining red in his hand and the light of his courage plain upon him and his hair spread out like threads of gold that change their colour on the edge of the anvil under the smiths band and the crow of battle in the air over his head  cuchulain is coming at us said erc to the men of ireland and let us be ready for him so they made a fence of shields linked together and erc put a couple of the men that were strongest here and there to let on to be fighting one another that they might call cuchulain to them and he put a druid with every couple of them and he bid the druid to ask cuchulains spears of him for it would be hard for him to refuse a druid for it was in the prophecy of the children of calatin that a king would be killed by each one of those spears in that battle  and he bid the men of ireland to give out shouts and cuchulain came against them in his chariot doing his    three thunder feats and he used his spear and his sword in such a way that their heads and their hands and their feet and their bones were scattered through the plain of muirthemne like the sands on the shore like the stars in the sky like the dew in may like snowflakes and hailstones like leaves of the trees like buttercups in a meadow like grass under the feet of cattle on a fine summer day it is red that plain was with the slaughter cuchulain made when he came crashing over it  then he saw one of the men that was put to quarrel with the other and the druid called to him to come and hinder them and cuchulain leaped towards them your spear to me cried the druid i swear by the oath of my people said cuchulain you are not so much in want of it as i am in want of it myself the men of ireland are upon me he said and i am upon them i will put a bad name on you if you refuse it to me said the druid there was never a bad name put on me yet on account of any refusal of mine said cuchulain and with that he threw the spear at him and it went through his head and it killed the men that were on the other side of him  then cuchulain drove through the host and lugaid son of curoi got the spear who is it will fall by this spear children of calatin said lugaid a king will fall by it said they then lugaid threw the spear at cuchulains chariot and it went through and hit the driver laeg son of riangabra and he fell back and his bowels came out on the cushions of the chariot my grief said laeg it is hard i am wounded then cuchulain drew the spear out and laeg said his farewell to him and cuchulain said: today i will be a fighter and a chariotdriver as well  then he saw the other two men that were put to quarrel with one another and one of them called out it would be a great shame for him not to give him his    help then cuchulain leaped towards them your spear to me cuchulain said the druid i swear by the oath my people swear by said he you are not in such want of the spear as i am myself for it is by my courage and by my arms that i have to drive out the four provinces of ireland that are sweeping over muirthemne today i will put a bad name upon you said the druid i am not bound to give more than one gift in the day and i have paid what is due to my name already said cuchulain then the druid said: i will put a bad name on the province of ulster because of your refusal  ulster was never dispraised yet for any refusal of mine said cuchulain or for anything i did unworthily though little of my life should be left to me ulster will not be reproached for me today with that he threw his spear at him and it went through his head and through the heads of the nine men that were behind him and cuchulain went through the host as he did before  then erc son of cairbre niafer took up his spear who will fall by this he asked the children of calatin a king will fall by it they said i heard you say the same thing of the spear that lugaid threw a while ago said erc that is true said they and the king of the chariotdrivers of ireland fell by it cuchulains driver laeg son of riangabra  with that erc threw the spear and it went through the grey of macha cuchulain drew the spear out and they said farewell to one another and then the grey went away from him with half his harness hanging from his neck and he went into glaslinn the grey pool in slieve fuad  then cuchulain drove through the host and he saw the third couple disputing together and he went between them as he did before and the druid asked his spear of him but he refused him i will put a bad name on    you said the druid i have paid what is due to my name today said he my honour does not bind me to give more than one request in a day i will put a bad name upon ulster because of your refusal i have paid what is due for the honour of ulster said cuchulain then i will put a bad name on your kindred said the druid the news that i have been given a bad name shall never go back to that place i am never to go back to myself for it is little of my life that is left to me said cuchulain with that he threw his spear at him and it went through him and through the heads of the men that were along with him  you do your kindness unkindly cuchulain said the druid as he fell then cuchulain drove for the last time through the host and lugaid took the spear and he said: who will fall by this spear children of calatin a king will fall by it said they i heard you saying that a king would fall by the spear erc threw a while ago that is true they said and the grey of macha fell by it that was the king of the horses of ireland  then lugaid threw the spear and it went through and through cuchulains body and he knew he had got his deadly wound and his bowels came out on the cushions of the chariot and his only horse went away from him the black sainglain with half the harness hanging from his neck and left his master the king of the heroes of ireland to die upon the plain of muirthemne  then cuchulain said: there is great desire on me to go to that lake beyond and to get a drink from it  we will give you leave to do that they said if you will come back to us after  i will bid you come for me if i am not able to come back myself said cuchulain  then he gathered up his bowels into his body and he went down to the lake he drank a drink and he washed himself and he returned back again to his    death and he called to his enemies to come and meet him  there was a pillarstone west of the lake and his eye lit on it and he went to the pillarstone and he tied himself to it with his breastbelt the way he would not meet his death lying down but would meet it standing up then his enemies came round about him but they were in dread of going close to him for they were not sure but he might be still alive  it is a great shame for you said erc son of cairbre not to strike the head off that man in revenge for his striking the head off my father  then the grey of macha came back to defend cuchulain as long as there was life in him and the herolight was shining above him and the grey of macha made three attacks against them and he killed fifty men with his teeth and thirty with each of his hoofs so there is a saying: it is not sharper work than this was done by the grey of macha the time of cuchulains death  then a bird came and settled on his shoulder it is not on that pillar birds were used to settle said erc  then lugaid came and lifted up cuchulains hair from his shoulders and struck his head off and the men of ireland gave three heavy shouts and the sword fell from cuchulains hand and as it fell it struck off lugaids right hand so that it fell to the ground then they cut off cuchulains hand in satisfaction for it and then the light faded away from about cuchulains head and left it as pale as the snow of a single night then all the men of ireland said that as it was maeve had gathered the army it would be right for her to bring away the head to cruachan i will not bring it with me it is for lugaid that struck it off to bring it with him said maeve and then lugaid and his men went away and they brought away cuchulains head and his    right hand with them and they went south towards the life river  at that time the army of ulster was gathering to attack its enemies and conall was out before them and he met the grey of macha and his share of blood dripping from him and then he knew that cuchulain was dead and himself and the grey of macha went looking for cuchulains body and when they saw his body at the pillarstone the grey of macha went and laid his head in cuchulains breast: that body is a heavy care to the grey of macha said conall  then conall went after the army thinking in his own mind what way he could get satisfaction for cuchulains death for it was a promise between himself and cuchulain that whichever of them would be killed the first the other would get satisfaction for his death  and if i am the first that is killed said cuchulain at that time how long will it be before you get satisfaction for me  before the evening of the same day said conall i will have got satisfaction for you and if it is i that will die before you he said how long will it be before you get satisfaction for me  your share of blood will not be cold on the ground said cuchulain when i will have got satisfaction for you  so conall followed after lugaid to the river life  lugaid was going down to bathe in the water but he said to his chariotdriver: look out there over the plain for fear would any one come at us unknown  the chariotdriver looked around him there is a man coming on us he said and it is in a great hurry he is coming and you would think he has all the ravens in ireland flying over his head and there are flakes of snow speckling the ground before him  it is not in friendship the man comes that is coming    like that said lugaid it is conall cearnach it is with dubdearg and the birds that you see after him they are the sods the horse has scattered in the air from his hoofs and the flakes of snow that are speckling the ground before him they are the froth that he scatters from his mouth and from the bit of his bridle look again said lugaid and see what way is he coming it is to the ford he is coming the same way the army passed over said the chariotdriver let him pass by us said lugaid for i have no mind to fight with him  but when conall came to the middle of the ford he saw lugaid and his chariotdriver and he went over to them welcome is the sight of a debtors face said conall the man you owe a debt to is asking payment of you now and i myself am that man he said for the sake of my comrade cuchulain that you killed and i am standing here now to get that debt paid  they agreed then to fight it out on the plain of magh argetnas and in the fight conall wounded lugaid with his spear from that they went to a place called ferta lugdac i would like that you would give me fair play said lugaid what fair play said conall cearnach  that you and i should fight with one hand said he for i have the use of but one hand  i will do that said conan then conalls hand was bound to his side with a cord and then they fought for a long time and one did not get the better of the other and when conall was not gaining on him his horse dubdearg that was near by came up to lugaid and took a bite out of his side  misfortune on me said lugaid it is not right or fair that is of you conall  it was for myself to do what is right and fair said conall  i made no promise for a beast that is without training and without sense    it is well i know you will not leave me till you take my head as i took cuchulains head from him said lugaid take it then along with your own head put my kingdom with your kingdom and my courage with your courage for i would like that you would be the best champion in ireland  then conall made an end of him and he went back bringing cuchulains head along with him to the pillar stone where his body was  and by that time emer had get word of all that had happened and that her husband had got his death by the men of ireland and by the powers of the children of calatin and it was levarcham brought her the story for conall cearnach had met her on his way and had bade her go and bring the news to emain macha and there she found emer and she sitting in her upper room looking over the plain for some word from the battle  and all the women came out to meet levarcham and when they heard her story they made an outcry of grief and sharp cries with loud weeping and burning tears and there were long dismal sounds going through emain and the whole country round was filled with crying and emer and her women went to the place where cuchulains body was and they gathered round it there and gave themselves to crying and keening  and when conall came back to the place he laid the head with the body of cuchulain and he began to lament along with them and it is what he said: it is cuchulain had prosperity on him a root of valour from the time he was but a soft child there never fell a better hero than the hero that fell by lugaid of the lands and there are many are in want of you he said and until all the chief men of ireland have fallen by me it is not fitting there should ever be peace  it is grief to me he to have gone into the battle    without conall being at his side it was a pity for him to go there without my body beside his body och it is he was my fosterson and now the ravens are drinking his blood there will not be either laughter or mirth since the hound has gone astray from us  let us bury cuchulain now said emer it is not right to do that said conall until i have avenged him on the men of ireland and it is a great shouting i hear about the plain of muirthemne and it is full the country is of crying after cuchulain and it is good at keeping the country and watching the boundaries the man was that is here before me a crosshacked body in a pool of blood and it is well it pleased lugaid son of curoi to be at the killing of cuchulain for it was cuchulain killed the chiefs and the children of deaguid round famain son of foraoi and round curoi son of daire himself and this shouting has taken away my wits and my memory from me he said and it is hard for me cuchulain not to answer these cries and i to be without him now for there is not a champion in ireland that was not in dread of the sword in his hand and it is broken in halves my heart is for my brother and i will bring my revenge through ireland now and i will not leave a tribe without wounding or true blood without spilling and the whole world will be told of my rout to the end of life and time until the men of munster and connaught and leinster will be crying for the rising they made against him and without the spells of the children of calatin the whole of them would not have been able to do him to death  after that complaint rage and madness came on conall and he went forward in his chariot to follow after the rest of the men of ireland the same way as he had followed after lugaid  and emer took the head of cuchulain in her hands and she washed it clean and put a silk cloth about it    and she held it to her breast and she began to cry heavily over it and it is what she said:  ochone said she it is good the beauty of this head was though it is low this day and it is many of the kings and princes of the world would be keening it if they knew the way it is now and the poets and the druids of ireland and of alban and many were the goods and the jewels and the rents and the tributes that you brought home to me from the countries of the world with the courage and the strength of your hands  and she made this complaint:  och head ochone o head you gave death to great heroes to many hundreds my head will lie in the same grave the one stone will be made for both of us  och hand ochone hand that was once gentle it is often it was put under my head it is dear that hand was to me  dear mouth ochone kind mouth that was sweetvoiced telling stories since the time love first came on your face you never refused either weak or strong  dear the man dear the man that would kill the whole of a great host dear his cold bright hair and dear his bright cheeks  dear the king dear the king that never gave a refusal to any thirty days it is tonight since my body lay beside your body  och two spears ochone two spears och shield och deadly sword let them be given to conall of the battles there was never any wage given like that  i am glad i am glad cuchulain of muirthemne i never brought red shame on your face for any unfaithfulness against you  happy are they happy are they who will never    hear the cuckoo again for ever now that the hound has died from us  i am carried away like a branch on the stream i will not bind up my hair today from this day i have nothing to say that is better than ochone  and then she said: it is long that it was showed to me in a vision of the night that cuchulain would fall by the men of ireland and it appeared to me dundealgan to be falling to the ground and his shield to be split from lip to border and his sword and his spears broken in the middle and i saw conall doing deeds of death before me and myself and yourself in the one death and oh my love she said we were often in one anothers company and it was happy for us for if the world had been searched from the rising of the sun to sunset the like would never have been found in one place of the black sainglain and the grey of macha and laeg the chariotdriver and myself and cuchulain and it is breaking my heart is in my body to be listening to the pity and the sorrowing of women and men and the harsh crying of the young men of ulster keening cuchulain and ulster to be in its weakness and without strength to revenge itself upon the men of ireland  and after she made that complaint she brought cuchulains body to dundealgan and they all cried and keened about him until such time as conall cearnach came back from making his red rout through the army of the men of ireland  for he was not satisfied to make a slaughter of the men of munster and connaught without reddening his hand in the blood of leinster as well  and when he had done that he came to dundealgan and his men along with him but they made no rejoicing when they went back that time and he brought the    heads of the men of ireland along with him in a gad and he laid them out on the green lawn and the people of the house gave three great shouts when they saw the heads  and emer came out and when she saw conall cearnach she said: my great esteem and my welcome before you king of heroes and may your many wounds not be your death for you have avenged the treachery done on ulster and now what you have to do is to make our grave and to lay us together in the grave for i will not live after cuchulain  and tell me conall she said whose are those heads all around on the lawn and which of the great men of ireland did they belong to  and she was asking and conall was answering and it is what she said:  tell me conall whose are those heads for surely you have reddened your arms with them tell me the names of the men whose heads are there upon the ground  and conall said: daughter of forgall of the horses young emer of the sweet words it is in revenge for the hound of feats i brought these heads here from the south  whose is the great black head with the smooth cheek redder than a rose it is at the far end on the left side the head that has not changed its colour  it is the head of the king of meath erc son of cairbre of swift horses i brought his head with me from far off in revenge for my own fosterson  whose is that head there before me with soft hair with smooth eyebrows its eyes like ice its teeth like blossoms that head is more beautiful in shape than the others  a son of maeve a destroyer of harbours yellowhaired maine man of horses i left his body without a head all his people fell by my hand    o great conall who did not fail us whose head is this you hold in your hand since the hound of feats is not living what do you bring in satisfaction for his head  the head of the son of fergus of the horses a destroyer in every battlefield my sisters son of the narrow tower i have struck his head from his body  whose is that head to the west with fair hair the head that is spoiled with grief i used to know his voice i was for a while his friend  that is he that struck down the hound lugaid son of curoi of the rhymes his body was laid out straight and fair i struck his head off afterwards  whose are those two heads farther out great conall of good judgment for the sake of your friendship do not hide the names of the men put down by your arms  the heads of laigaire and clar cuilt two men that fell by my wounds it was they wounded faithful cuchulain i made my weapons red in their blood  whose are those heads farther to the east great conall of bright deeds the hair of the two is of the one colour their cheeks are redder than a calfs blood  brave cullain and hardy cunlaid two that were used to overcome in their anger there to the east emer are their heads i left their bodies in a red pool  whose are those three heads with evil looks i see before me to the north their faces blue their hair black even hard conalls eye turns from them  three of the enemies of the hound daughters of calatin wise in enchantments they are the three witches killed by me their weapons in their hands  o great conall father of kings whose is that head that would overcome in the battle his bushy hair is    goldyellow his headdress is smooth and white like silver  it is the head of the son of redhaired ross son of necht min that died by my strength this emer is his head the high king of leinster of speckled swords  o great conall change the story how many of the men that harmed him fell by your hand that does not fail in satisfaction for the head of cuchulain  it is what i say ten and seven scores of hundreds is the number that fell back to back by the anger of my hard sword and of my people  o conall what way are they the women of ireland after the hound are they mourning the son of sualtim are they showing respect through their grief  o emer what shall i do without my cuchulain my fine nurseling going in and out from me tonight  o conall lift me to the grave raise my stone over the grave of the hound since it is through grief for him i go to death lay my mouth to the mouth of cuchulain  i am emer of the fair form there is no more vengeance for me to find i have no love for any man it is sorrowful my stay is after the hound  and after that emer bade conall to make a wide very deep grave for cuchulain and she laid herself down beside her gentle comrade and she put her mouth to his mouth and she said: love of my life my friend my sweetheart my one choice of the men of the earth many is the woman wed or unwed envied me till today: and now i will not stay living after you  and her life went out from her and she herself and cuchulain were laid in the one grave by conall and he raised the one stone over them and he wrote their    names in ogham and he himself and all the men of ulster keened them  but the three times fifty queens that loved cuchulain saw him appear in his druid chariot going through emain macha and they could hear him singing the music of the sidhe
