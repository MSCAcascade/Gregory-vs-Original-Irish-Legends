here we show how the third troop was equippedeven the troop wherein mani was fifty chestnut horses were in itthey were big of body and of wondrous sizealso fifty white horses with chestnut earstheir tails were long and the manes and the tails were dyed to the colour of purple on each horse was a bridle of two reins shells of gold ornamented one of the reins and shells of silver were on the other the bits of them all were of gold and of silver at the neck of each horse hung a round plate of gold to which little bells had been fastened and the bells as they swung to the horses tread chimed together in music as sweetly as lute strings struck by a masters hand each pair of horses was yoked to a chariot of white bronze whose rim was made of silver and gold fifty caparisons of purple with threads of silver run through them were bound to the bodies of the chariots they had golden buckles to fasten them and hung over the rims marvellous figures were embroidered thereon fifty graceful youths with fair countenances stood in these fifty chariots amongst them there was none who was not the son of a king and a queen and of a hero and warrior of connaught they were clothed in fifty purple cloaks whose borders were adorned with silver and gold there were four bronze ears on every cloak and each was fastened with a clasp of red gold purified in the fire close fitting garments woven with silk and with fastenings of glowing yellow gold were girded on their white bodies fifty silver bucklers for the fight hung on their backs the rims of the bucklers were of gold and they were adorned with many kinds of carbuncles and with costly stones of every colour two gleams of valour shone from the fivepointed spears that were in the hand of each man of them there were fifty rivets of white bronze and of gold upon every spear if from each of these heroes a bushel of gold had been due the rivets of his lance had been enough for the full payment of the debt each of the spears had about it rings of gold purified in the fire and rested on a socket of carbuncles which in like fashion to the spears had been embellished with many coloured costly stones they shone in the night like the beams of the sun at their belts hung fifty long swords the hilts of the swords were of tooth adorned with gold and with silver the scabbards were of white silver in their hands were fifty whips of white bronze with clasps of gold upon them  very beautiful and splendid was the young prince whom they accompanied long were his cheeks radiant and broad was his countenance long curling and golden was his hair and it fell to his shoulders proud and glowing were his eyes blue and clear as the crystal like to the tops of the woods in may or to the foxglove of the mountain was each of his cheeks you might fancy that a rain of pearls had fallen into his mouth and that his lips were twin branches of coral white as the newfallen snow of the night was his neck and such was the fashion of his skin seven dogs of the chase surrounded his chariot with chains of silver upon them and an apple of gold on every chain and the tinkle of the apples on the chains made a pleasant music no colour can be imagined that was not upon the dogs that were with him seven buglers with bugles of silver and gold went with the dogs many coloured were the garments in which they were clad and yellow was their hair before them went three druids with crowns of silver on their heads their mantles were of many colours their shields were of copper and the rims of the shields were brass they were attended by three harpplayers in purple cloaks each of them kingly to look upon  in this fashion then they came to croghan and three times they paraded upon the plain of croghan they parted from maev and from alill and they turned to the road for the journey to rath mi fair is the start that you make said briccriu as he saw them go but will you look so fair when you return for that i cannot tell  by the journey before us said mani shall the riddle you set us be solved  right well do i know answered briccriu that one day is enough for your march nor for a night will you dare to remain within the kingdom of conor to hold therein your feast  now i pledge you my word answered mani that till for three days and three nights we have kept our feast at dun geirg we turn not again to croghan no longer did he tarry to bandy words but he gat him on his way for the journey  now when the news of their coming arrived at dun geirg they commenced to prepare for the reception of the bridal party the houses were strewn with fairleaved greenleaved birches and with a deep litter of fresh rushes and ferh sent her friend and playmate findchoem who was the daughter of erg that she might go with the woman who acted as herald and observe the coming of that party in what fashion they came not long was the time that she needed and when she had well beheld the host and had noted their array she hastened and came with sure tidings to the bower where ferb was and thus she spoke to heri see said she a host come to this burg and never since conor has ruled in eman bath come nor shall come to the end of time a fairer host or one more skilled in dainty feats than this that comes across the plain it seemed to me that i was in a sweet orchard of apples such was the fragrance that came from their garments when they were waved by the gentle breeze that swept across them and for the feats and the frolics shown by the prince that is among them never before saw i the like he casts his staff for the distance of a spear cast in front of him his dogs springing behind in such fashion that there are the dogs bounding between the staff and the ground there is the prince leaning over between the staff and the sky and the staff falleth not to the ground for together between them they seize it  the people of dun geirg pressed around as the party approached so that sixteen of the beholders were stifled at the viewing of it and they leapt from their chariots at the gate of the burg and the chariots were let down and their horses were unyoked and they came into the castle and a right fair welcome was bid them and preparations were made for a goodly bath they gave them that bath in the great hail of the warriors that was hard by the castle and presently noble supplies came in to them of all those kinds of excellent provisions that can be found on the ridge of the earth  but while yet they had joy in the pleasure of the feast a fierce and violent blast of wind arose and it shook the whole hill on which the castle stood and the house of wood wherein the guests were quaked at the blast so that the shields fell from their hooks and the spears from their places and the tables were moved like the leaves in a forest of oak the young men were astonished and gerg demanded of the druid who attended upon mani what this wind should betide and to him answered ollgaeth the druid of mant truly said he to me it seemeth that no good omen is this with which we have come hither for the courtship this evening conor shall come upon you beware of his coming and at the dawn of the morning maev shall be defeated in battle whilst you all shall perish as many as are within this house and he made thereupon the following poema model for future times  i  the storm wind roars its warnings clear with dread we hear the cry pierced through the loins by charioteer the kingly cerg must die slain by the javelins cast a deed of poison ito and fro  fly lances dripping shoulders bleed to triumph rides the foe the hands flash white as blows they heap on shields that roar and quake a peaceful couch for men that sleep in death the cairn shall make the king uplifts his spear and slays a prince sharp deeds are done a tomb above the dead they raise and sad the tale will run: badb shall destroy force wild and dread from maev the field shall win the slain lie heaped her host hath fled how sad the storm winds din i   if ye be obedient to my counsel said the druid this very night shall ye depart from the castle and mani was wroth and with anger he rebuked the druid for the words which he had spoken and no cause said gerg is there why ye should be in terror for him of whom he hath warned you since no muster of heroes or of warriors from ulster hath conor with him at all even were you not here to defend yourselves said he i myself with my two sons would give battle to conor and they lifted up their fallen weapons and they paid no heed to the words which the druid had spoken  now as conor in the morning of that day lay asleep in eman his queen mugain etanchaitrech the daughter of eocho fedlech lying beside him he saw a fair woman who came to him as he lay on his couch her bearing was the bearing of a queen her hair was golden and wavy and was braided into a tress coiled about her head through a thin robe woven of silken threads shone her white skin a soft and glossy kerchief of green silk lay on her neck two sandals of white bronze rounded in front appeared between her tender feet and the ground  all blessings be on thee o conor said she  tell me said conor what this vision showeth to me  in seven years from this night said the lady shall the raid of the kine of cualgne be accomplished and the land of ulster shall be laid waste and the dun bull of cualgne shall be driven off and the son of the man who shall do these deeds even mani morgor the son of alill and maev he hath come hither for his wedding with ferb the daughter of gerg of glenn geirg three times fifty is the number of his companions make ready said she three times fifty of the men of the fomorians to match them and victory shall be with thee up sprang conor and he waked his queen and told her of his vision  truly said mugain the queen there hath been enough of strife already betwixt us and the men of connaught  nevertheless said conor it is a certain thing that even if we hold back from the war the raid of which she bath spoken shall be accomplished  take counsel with cathba said mugairi and the counsel that he giveth to thee let that be what thou shalt follow  upon that conor spoke to cathba on the matter desiring him to give him a prophetic reply and he made thereon the first lines of a poem and cathba replied to him and the poem runs as follows   ii  conor cathba speak ray mind is troubled let thine art the clouds dispel what destruction hangs before me emans druid cathba tell  cathba conor stately king of ulster as the lord of heroes known many men shall fall in battle this was by your vision shown  conor tell me all the ill that follows give a prophecy thats true cheat me not for fear of danger never druid spoke like you  cathba mani raised above dishonour son of croghans maev shall fall three times fifty comrades with him wailing shall arise for all  none escape or find returning of the troops from croghan fair higher shall your fame be burning seek it guard yourself with care  in safety shalt thou return o king said he with triumph and conquest and fame  now it happened that at that time cathach the catheaded dimors daughter had arrived in eman a famous warrior was she and from the land of spain she had come to eman for the love that she bore to cuchulainn and she joined with conor for that war  also there joined with him three men of renown who came of the race of the fomoriansfamous were they for their crueltynamely siabarchenn the son of suilremar and berngal the freckled and bun of the cruel speech thither came also facen the son of dublongsech who was of the race of the men who of old time dwelled in the land of ulster and fabric called fabric of the venomous tooth who came from the greater asia and foras the slayer of his brother who dwelt in the island of man and conor marched away three times fifty warriors who surrounded these chiefs being with him and he took none of the ulstermen with him save himself only and brod his charioteer and imrinn the druid who was the son of cathba and none of these warriors had a servant with him save that servant of conor only but they had their shields on their backs and their bright green spears in their hands and their heavy hardstriking swords at their belts yet they were not to be despised on account of their numbers the pride of their souls was great and when they had come to such y place that the castle of gerg could be seen by them they saw a vast and heavy cloud that brooded over the castle the one end of the cloud was black as coal and its middle was red and the other end was green whereupon conor spoke to imrinn the druidtell me o imrinn said he what omen signifieth that cloud that we see over the castle  truly said imrinn it signifleth a nightlong contest and death for this night then he made the following poem of lyric verse   iii  yon dark cloud that stifles with poisonous breath green and red are its edges compelling the death for keen weapons cut gashes in sides and hands tear and aloft the sword flashes and necks are swept bare in gergs lofty dwelling the ninth hour is knelling of death it is telling that rages till noon a youth in his daring black death is preparing the ground shall be bearing a graveharvest soon  conor then advanced and drew towards the castle now there was at that time a brazen vat set up in the house which in later times was known by the name of the olguala and it was filled with wine from the band of the cupbearer a polished drinking vessel fell into the vat so that three ripples were formed therein and the ripples flowed over the rim then thus spoke ollgaeth the druid   iv  woes me said the druid theres broth in the cup too soon shall a stranger the beaker fill up troops shall wounded be lying and heroes be dying eman macha be sighing and houses shall fall knights of gerg fight in duel with conors men cruel till the daylights renewal drives night from the hall sad was the birth of men foredoomed to fight within the house of royal gerg tonight  conor came to the door and his foreign warriors as their custom was raised their cry of havock round about the castle and gerg arose and with him his two sonsto wit conn the victorious and cobhtach of the fair skin and they caught hold of their weapons and gerg said to mani do then leave us ulstermen to ourselves to decide this matter that thou mayest see which of us is the more valiant we are all bound in honour to see to thy safety and it would be no hurt to thee should we all fall here together and if it should indeed be that it is for us that death hath here been decreed then do thou win the mastery in this place if so be that thou art able gerg and his two sons then went out and his people with him and they set them to defend the burg and after that to go outside and to fight against conor and for a long time they let in none behind them now on a time gerg went across the threshold to meet the foremost of those who pressed forward and eagerly they strove to cut that hero off from the fortress and in all directions and on all sides sword cuts and thrusts fell upon him as he stood outside the castle and it followed that during this attack five of the fomorians fell at the hand of gerg also by him fell imrinn the druid who was the son of cathba and gerg struck the head from his shoulders and he took the head with him and he made for the door then came cathach the catheaded between gerg and the door and a sharp hot contest she gave him nevertheless gerg struck off het head and he took it with him into the house where mani was though he himself had been sorely wounded and he threw the head from him in front of mani and he sat him down upon a couch and he sighed grievously and bade them give him to drink and conor came up with his people so that they were on the outside of the stockade they held their shields in their left hands over their heads and with their right hands they tore down the stockade and they strode across it so that they were on the soil of that burg  thus they had a good door made for them after that they had broken the rampart  thereupon brodthe servant aforementioned of conorhurled one of the two spears that he had in his hand and the spear flew into the house and it went through the shield that was on the breast of king gerg and into his tender flesh so that a cross was made by the spear as it passed through his body after piercing his heart also it passed through airidech the servant of gerg so that both fell lifeless conor then turned him to attack the followers of gerg throughout the castle so that thirty fighting men of gergs people fell at his single hand besides what fell by the hands of his followers and many of the people also fell at their hands  then nuagel arose the daughter of erg she who was the wife of gerg and she raised her three bitter cries of grief and she took the head of her man into her lap  truly said she a great deed do i reckon that deed which the servant brod hath wrought in that he hath slain gerg in his own palace and many said she will lament thee and though it was in thy daughters quarrel that thou art fallen many were the maidens to whom thou thyself wert dear and loudly she gave testimony of this and thus she commenced her lay   v  here gerg lies slain  his daughters fault hath caused the woe that now i tell for her struck down in fierce assault that lordly chieftains fighting fell  gergs wars were great to war he went with bloodred weapons active still fair noble and magnificent wise handsome manly full of skill  no hero ever gerg surpassed each heath that knew his martial tread boils up with wrath  the tears fall fast in every host for gerg is dead  tis sad your deathbed thus to tend  my lovely gerg with locks so fair  whom armies hailed as constant friend  tis woe for me to see you there  with me who in glenn geirg here stand by irard and by loch anes shore by many a spring in southern land are loving dames who weep you sore  the hosts to you were friends and each your lightest wish with joy obeyed to all was dear your friendly speech your counsels wise their judgment swayed  the lawyers hailed your wise decrees assemblies of your state could learn your nobles knew your courtesies and foes your deeds in battle stern  your house was great and widely known although you wounded were therein they killed you there upon your throne the deed they did was deadly sin  the courtship of ferb for little he deserved such fame the servant brod his spear passed through and with one cast it overcame your henchman airidech and you  brods feat of arms was great although an impious deed that slave hath wrought before his time a kings laid low and i with him to death am brought  now after these things had been done the two sons of gerg namely cobhtach of the fair skin and conn the victorious strove to hold the castle and deadly was the fight that was fought before they gave way nor did the might of mani permit him to bide still in his place or to hold back from avenging his fatherinlaw against the men of ulster he arose and he took his great battleshield upon him and his two smooth sharp spears into his hand and his heavy hardstriking sword at his belt  and three times fifty of his comrades rose together with him it were no easy thing to restrain him the mind and the nature of each of these heroes was swollen with pride the hearts of them all overflowed with their arrogance greatly they longed and desired to do some doughty deed  stately loveworthy and of gallant bearing was the kings son that went before them though to the eyes of an older man he seemed but a boy he showed himself afterward to be a warrior of great valour pleasant was he in the banquetinghall and stubborn in the strife he was a snake full of poison he was wary of the craft of his enemies he was the flame of war he was a fit match for a foe that rose up against him  he was liberal with his treasure he could show compassion to the wounded he cruld blaze up at an insult he stood like a firmrooted rock against violence he could overwhelm wild might like a billow of justice he was swift as a roebuck he was steadfast as an oak he was the head of the three provinces of connaght in battle and wounding he was their chief in assemblies their distributor of treasure and their good material for an accomplished king  he held it to be dishonourable that any man at all in the world should come with numbers no greater than his own and take the house where he was therefore he and his warriors chased the fomorians and they drove them from the palace in that hour the hand of mani was not the hand of a healer for nine of the men of the fomorians fell at his first attack and then to the front of the fight came the pirate of greater asiaeven fabric of the venomous tooth and upon the press of people that were before him caine blows and destruction and confusion and death nor could any resist him till he came to that part of the battle where mani was then those two set shield against shield and they strove with each other in a strife that lasted till the middle of the night and fabric dealt mani three grievous wounds and mani smote the head off him after that he had grown weary in the strife and as to conor the might of a hero was his for at his hand fell thirty valiant men of the people of gerg and with them fell the son of gerg even conn the victorious thus on either side the army rushed to the attack almost it seemed that the toes on their feet warred together in the strife throughout the castle the warriors stood kneedeep in blood and through the surrounding country was heard the splintering of the shields and the bucklers and the whirr of the bright green lances and the clash of the sharp hard swords and the shatterirg of skulls in the slaughter and the cries of the warriors who were overcome in a strife that was greater than they could endure  now after the death of the chief of the fomorians mani met facen the son of dublongsech and for a long time they fought and facen fell at the end of that fight also at the hand of cobhtach the fairskinned who was the son of gerg died siaburchenn the son of suilremuir but mani and cobhtach were forced into the royal palace after their people had suffered defeat and they held that palace bravely and manfully till the morning nor could any enter in of those who fought against them  at the end of this night the same woman who had brought the message to conor went on her way and came to maev where she lay asleep on her couch at cruachan ay and thus she addressed her: hadst thou the gift of prophecy o maev said she thou wouldest not be sleeping  what then hath happened said the queen  conor said the woman hath all but gained the victory over mani ihd mani shall fall at his hand arise and thou shalt avenge him  then she made the first lines of a poem and maev while she slept replied to her   vi  the badb hath your fate from you been hidden maev that sleeping here you lie rest to you would be forbidden were you skilled in prophecy  maev sure your tales of evil omen lady pale divinely fair tell me whence they come my foemen what their state what name they bear  the badb conor many a field who gaineth chief of ulsters lords in fight rage and fury naught restraineth till he sack glenn geirg tonight  maev why of conor be affrighted he will hardly win the glen gerg to mani s power united is enough for conors men  the badb mani is of noble figure lofty courage fires his mind yet too small tonight his vigour in the glen the war shall find  maev well if mani more is dying death shall rage through vanquished hosts connaught raises heroes vieing with the best that eman boasts  the badb rise the hosts of connaught calling vengeance full for mani take troops shall at your hand be falling royal maev when you awake  thereupon maev awoke and she waked alill and she told him of the vision which she had seen and afterwards she recounted it to her people  i know well that there is no truth in that story said briccriu but when fiannamail the son of fergus forderg even the son of him that was the steward of croghan heard the news he waited not for any other but departed before maev was ready for mani was his fosterbrother now the eighth place among the youths of connaught belonged to fiannamail maev selected seven hundred armed men the best that could at the time be found in croghan then came donnell the red surnamed donnell of the broad countenance the son of duban who was the son of lngamain he was the best warrior under shield and sword and spear to be found in the province of connaught and he also was fosterbrother to mani and he followed on the track of fiannamail in front of all the others thirty warriors had he with him and the name of each one of them was donnell maev also followed with her host behind donnell and his men thus far runs the tale of the vision of maev and the cause of the war that she made  now we return to tell of the doom of mani he held the palace till sunrise and pleasant was the dawn of the day but no cheerful or pleasant rest for him and his foes had been found that night and when those two warring hosts saw each other by daylight they bethought them anew of their quarrel each of them desiring to do each other hurt and thus bean conor to urge on his followers to the fight : had it been ulstermen that i had with me said he this battle would not have been fought in such fashion as it hath been by the fomorians courage rose high in the hearts of all the fomorians as they heard this rebuke and stubbornly and vehemently they rushed to the fight and they ceased not from it till they had entered through the door of the royal palacei the palace into which they had come was fair and of great renown evil and sad was the fate that befell it there were therein a hundred tables of silver and three hundred of brass and three hundred of white bronze there were moreover thirty drinking bowls with white silver from spain on the rims of the bowls also there were two hundred drinking horns made from the horns of oxen with chasings of gold and of silver and thirty beakers of silver and thirty of brass  and at the wall there was a bedplace with fair white linen sheets wondrous designs were woven upon them  then came both those hosts together into the midst of the house and much of death befell cobhtach the fairskinned he who was the son of gerg after that he had smitten the fomorians came to that part of the fight where berngal the freckled was raging and smiting the heads off the warriors of connaught and berngal became weary in the strife and he fell by the hand of cobhtach in another part of the palace bun of the cruel speech died at the hand of mani who then fell into a wild frenzy and raged among the fomorians throughout the palace thirty falling at his hand but when that valiant hero conor the evervictorious in war saw the fury of mani he turned to meet him and mani awaited him vigilant in his wrath and they fought a long time together and they trampled nine young men under foot mani hurled his spear the breadth of a spearcast with wrath and fury so that it made a cross passing through the body of conor and as conor struggled to draw out the spear mani wounded him again with the bright green spear that was in his hand and brod came up to aid conor and mani fetched him three grievous wounds and brod was after that unfit for war conor turned him again upon mani and overwhelmed him with crushing blows so that he fell lifeless and dead then he began to hew down upon all sides the men that were round him so that they fell foot to foot and neck to neck throughout the palace moreover it so chanced that of the thrice fifty warriors who came with conor into that house none escaped alive save himself and brod and although these two came out yet they came not out unhurt and cobhtach the son of gerg fled from out of the castle and conor chased him and as he followed him over the plain the maiden namely ferb the daughter of gerg came and with her her comrade who had brought her the news of the coming of mani they came together to the place where mani lay in his gore a bloody disfigured form and she mourned and she wept  truly said she thou art lonely now yet on many nights as i reckon thou hast had the fellowship of many and she sang this lament while she made testimony for him   vii  o boy your couch is red with gore  illomened from your home you came  for signs had told that weeping sore  your kindred soon should hear your name  o son of maev her peoples queen o lofty shoot of high renown who cause of all our grief hast been since here at duskyou laid you down  no weakling alill is whose deeds on you as son his fame confer my heart for grief within me bleeds that low you lie in sepulchre  o golden sceptre on a bed your skill bright youth all skill surpassed yet when to fight your foe was led for you that contest was the last  your hand was rough in fiercest fight fomorians of your force can tell down crashed your blows with thundring might not few the men on whom you fell  your colour beauteous was and bright with care you did all duties well across each vale your foot flew light not few the men on whom you fell  tis right that i your loss should moan  although i never knew your kiss  not less my love in silence shown  though love bath set my life amiss  o son of maev my heart is woe for you my love that here you lie my heart itself i mourning know awaits the selfsame destiny  not often weaponless you went till stiff and cold in death you lay one shining spear your flesh bath rent another took your life away  and you were hacked by cruel sword and down your cheeks fell crimson rain and all the troop that called you lord have felt with you deaths grievous pain  small note i make of all on earth for none such grief as mine can see my sweetheart dear my man of worth and chosen from the world for me  my man of worth fo all my days my mani more great alills son  not once mine eyes to his to raise  i cannot bear it life is done  upon his purple robe i look his royal garb and know with grief that none that vesture from him took since first he stood a weaponed chief  he on the ground his hand lies near cut by a blow some foeman dealt and in a hero stands his spear his head it hangs at conors belt  the heavy sword he well could wield has conor taken far from hence and where he fell there lies his shield wherewith for all he made defence  thrice fifty warriors lie around alas they no protection gave they sighed to leave their native ground but bravely died their prince to save  he truly valiant was to all largesse he freely gave of gold no little quarrel caused his fall to save his people life he sold  his guards lie round of life bereft the prince of connaught lieth there woe for his folk though honours left and woe for me his consort fair  and nothing i for you can do an evil deed hath wrecked my joy and as the grisly sight i view my heart is broken for you boy  then came fiannamail the son of fergus forderg to the castle and three times fifty was the number of the warriors that were with him and a herald who preceded him gave to ferb the news of his coming and to fiannamail he brought back a sad message to tell him of the deeds which had been done fiannamail immediately flew into a rage and sought eagerly for tidings of where conor was to be found and he and ferb between them made this song  viii  ferb fiannamail whose kin for ever lie in death draws nigh the hail truly gallant is his bearing as he answers to our call  fian maiden much your message moved me  mournful was the news it brought  that my kin were dead  but valiant  was the fight if here they fought  ferb here your kindred lie yet little need to speak their forms you know far and wide they fell and falling slew in blood full many a foe  fian speak of mani is he living is my comrade lying here whom as chief in hail i follow who as friend to me is dear  ferb champion fiannamail arouse you grief as yet unknown to face grieved i hear your word and answer  you have found his restingplace  fian fairest ferb my wrath is rising tell me all the tidings sore if you knowthe son of alill tell mewhere is mani more  ferb ah ochone the bitter sorrow was not all my meaning plain manis dead and in the battle all his chivalry were slain  fian who has caused the cruel conflict whose the arms that shone in strife who has slain the royal mani have his foes been left in life  ferb bloodred swords of warlike ulster came in strength from out the north three times fifty valiant warriors from the palace drove us forth  fian though the guilty now escape us not for them the poets lay ulster east and west shall perish connaughts sons are here today  ferb fiannamail the skilled in battle listen  all the tale i tell: two of those who came are living all the rest from ulster fell  fian name for me the two who are they tell me how in fight they fared whither fled they who to hurt us such a deed to do have dared  ferb fear no lie from me with conor brod escaped that slaughter great with two spears was conor smitten brod with three alike their state  fian who hath wounded crooked conor who hath made him thus to bleed though from here he fled in safety woe to him if leech he need  ferb thus it chanced the spear of mani twice the blood from conor drew to the death then conor smote him fiannamail the tale is true  after this fiannamail pushed forward in pursuit of conor and to meet him came niall the fair headed who was the son of conor and with him a hundred armed men of conors household who were seeking where the king might be a hot wild battle was fought between them and as the upshot thereof fiannamail overcome by the numbers against him was vanquished nor did he reap advantage from the equal number on his own side for he fell lifeless and dead yet thirty of his foes fell by his single arm alone and then the maiden namely ferb turned her and looked at the young warriors of connaught  truly said she do i reckon that it is not owing to lack of valour or of skill that you died nay but you overcome by the numbers against you were vanquished yet said she an equal number of your foes have been slain by you even though you also have fallen and she sang the following song  ix  for connaughts young warriors hard cushions are spread their eyes have been smitten their light step has fled  what army excelled you in beauty or strife ah masterless flutter the threads of your life  for your eyestrings are shattered deaths poison prevails as the cold corpses gather the stubborn fight fails  a hundred armed heroes the dog for you tore your grim tale foreshadows fresh fights sorrow sore  i know you with sorrow and weeping i yearn in company with you to ashes to burn  young connaught menerin no fairer troop knows  i mourn for you slaughtered by illshapen foes  your fight with fomorians a fierce fight has been behind your proud corpses the women will keen  to the house you came proudly no vassal your sire as chieftains it was not for you to retire  pale badb have you feasted the weapons among of the fair youths of connaught the sad fate is sung  then came donnell the red the son of dubanhe that was called donnell of the broad countenanceand he arrived at the foot of the hill upon which the castle stood  donnell the red the son of duban said the maiden who had been ferbs messenger is a trusty man in all matters where the spear and the sword can avail dauntless in the hour wherein valiant deeds are done is each of those who have come hither and mighty would have been the aid that donnell would have lent to his fosterbrother had it been his fortune to come hither while mani was yet in life and when the maiden ferb heard that she went out that she might meet donnell and much she incited him to the fight and she made a part of a song and donnell derg of the broad countenance he made answer to her  x  ferb valiant hawk of danger flying forth for fame who here hast sped donnell see before thee lying is thy fosterbrother dead  donnell mani died in fight the story lives how he his rivals still passed in fame in valour glory in his mercy in his skill  ferb not for

would then be cheerful peace would then my heart enjoy if but donnells arms so fearful all of ulster would destroy  no long time had donnell to wait for he saw a great host coming towards him in which were four hundred armed men and their leader was feradach of the long hand who was the son of conor each of these foes set themselves against the other then donnell finding himself overcome by the numbers against him fell into a rage fifty warriors fell at his single hand and all the men of his following were slain while he himself twice succeeded in wounding feradach but with murder his foes strove against him and feradach struck off his head and he raised the shout of victory moreover the heads of all his companions were struck off and loudly the cries of triumph were raised by the victors  and that maiden went back to the castle and she entered in and as her eyes fell upon mani she was overwhelmed with her grief hideous said she is that which hath befallen us oh youth and it is on your account that in sorrow i will die although my father and his son also have died in your quarrel and methinks that yet more of slaughter shall there be when maev shall have come and she made the following lament in her sorrow   xi  o son of maev in sadness i complain o lovely youth endowed with wondrous skill your skin so clear the ruddy blooddrops stain in you i see the cause of all our

well i know the cause that did our quiet life disturb whence much of evil shall in future flow for all the folk of mani and of ferb  my heart within me with sharp pain was racked when first your deathbed to mine eyes was shown i curse the hands that thus your flesh have hacked and on a cruel couch your corpse have thrown  to dames and maidens comes a bitter grief for you who showed such skill the spear to toss and many hosts are mourning for their chief lamenting you a single deepest loss  but yesterday you shone in beauty bright your hounds careering in the cheerful chase your soul was lofty and a youthful light was proudly shining in your glorious face  ill favoured now your countenance and dead beside you lie your hands so cold and pale and severed from your body is your head alas for him who cannot for you wail  an evil news they carry to the west to that bright hostage finnabar the fair her brothers death with grief will fill her breast shell weep for ferb who such a loss must bear  nor maev nor alill on mag ay who dwell can yet endure to live and bear such woes and none thy countenance so changed can tell alas my cup of sorrow overflows  then came to the side of conor his two sons even niall and feradach and macv drew nigh till she was in sight of the field of battle and seven hundred warriors was the following that she had with her she formed her troops into a compact and stubborn band and she raised weapons fit for the battle before her and she made straight for conor to take vengeance on him for the death of her son and of the people thai were with him and although conor was full of wounds and of hurts yet he was not minded to give way and to retire before maev but he advanced eagerly to seek her out till those two stood face to face each then commenced to deal out blows and mutilation and destruction and to hew down and to crush and to slay and the piercer of the ranks of war was by maev carried into the battle host of ulster so that five men fell at her hand besides the two sons of conor even niall the fairheaded and feradach of the long hand and on the other side conor began to rend asunder the remaining part of her host and to tear and to slay like a wrathful wounded lioness among swine so that quickly had he found his healing from his wounds after which as it were great pieces of flesh full of blood fell from him in the greatness of the wrath that had seized him after his two sons had been slain  then maev was defeated and three times fifty mightily valiant warriors of her people fell in the fight and her guards as their custom was bore her safely back and conor followed hard upon her routed host till he passed beyond mag mi then back he turned him and he made for the castle of gerg with the intent to lay it in ruins thereupon the people of gerg gathered together and cobhtach of the fairskin who was the son of gerg led them to the fight a violent and a well matched battle they fought in defence of their fortress but conor rushed upon them like a wolf among sheep and he and cobhtach fought in single combat and cobhtach fell in that fight and then fell also all of his people that were doomed to death and conor took with him whatsoever he found there of gold and of silvei and of white bronze and of horn and of beakers and of vessels and of weapons and of apparel he took with him also the brazen vat that stood in the house which when full of beer was wont to be sufficient for the whole land of ulster and this is that vat which by the men of ulster was called the ol guala or coalvat since a fire of coals guail was wont to be in that house in eman in which that vat was drunk and from it bath been named loch guala umai in the island of daim which is in the realm of ulster for underneath the lake unto this day is that vat hidden in a secret place also conor took with him the queen even nuagel the daughter of erg and her daughter ferb and three times fifty maidens with her and immediately after this ferb and her maidens all died from the sorrow that they felt at the death of the young man mani nuagel also died of grief for the death of her husband and her two sons and they dug a grave for ferb and a pillar of stone was erected for her and her name was written upon it in letters of ogham and a monument of stone was made so that duma ferbe is the name that is now for raith iniin the northwest doth that monument stand  conor returned to eman with victory and triumph and to mugain he related his tale from the beginning to the end and he gave command to his bard ferchertne the son of dergerdne who was the son of garb who was the son of fer rossa the red who was the son of rury that he should forthwith make a great poem which should serve as a model to future times and should preserve the memory of that tale he then sang the poem that now follows and he prophesied that in future days by means of the tale he had told should men unravel the threads of the story of the tain
