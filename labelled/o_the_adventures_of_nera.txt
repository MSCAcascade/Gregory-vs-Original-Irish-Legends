one halloween ailill and medb were in rath cruachan with their whole household they set about cooking food two captives had been banged by them the day before that then ailill said: he who would now put a withe round the foot of either of the two captives that are on the gallows shall have a prize for it from me as he may choose  great was the darkness of that night and its horror and demons would appear on that night always each man of them went out in turn to try that night and quickly would he come back into the house i will have the prize from thee said nera and i shall go out truly thou shalt have this my goldhilted sword here said ailill  then this nera went out towards the captives and put good armour on him he put a withe round the foot of one of the two captives thrice it sprang off again then the captive said to him unless he put a proper peg on it though he be at it till the morrow he would not fix his own peg on it then nera put a proper peg on it  said the captive from the gallows to nera: that is manly o nera manly indeed said nera by the truth of thy valour take me on thy neck that i may get a drink with thee i was very thirsty when i was hanged come on my neck then said nera so he went on his neck whither shall i carry thee said nera to the house which is nearest to us  said the captive  so they went to that house then they saw something a lake of fire round that house there is no drink for us in this house said the captive there is no fire without sparing in it ever let us therefore go to the other house which is nearest to us said the captive they went to it then and saw a lake of water around it do not go to that house said the captive there is never a washing nor a bathingtub nor a sloppail in it at night after sleeping let us still go to the other house said the captive now there is my drink in this house said the captive he let him down on the floor he went into the house there were tubs for washing and bathing in it and a drink in either of them also a sloppail on the floor of the house he then drinks a draught of either of them and scatters the last sip from his lips at the faces of the people that were in the house so that they all died henceforth it is not good to havel either a tub for washing or bathing or a fire without sparing or a sloppail in a house after sleeping  thereupon he carried him back to his torture and nera returned to cruachan then be saw something the dun was burnt before him and he beheld a heap of heads of their people cut off by the warriors from the dun he went after the host then into the cave of cruachan a man on the track here said the last man to nera the heavier is the track said his comrade to him and each man said that word to his mate from the last man to the first man thereupon they reached the sid of cruachan and went into it then the heads were displayed to the king in the sid what shall be done to the man that came with you said one of them let him come hither that i may speak with him said the king then nera came to them and the king said to him: what brought thee with the warriors into the sid said the king to him i came in the company of thy host said nera go now to yonder house said the king there is a single woman there who will make thee welcome tell her it is from me thou art sent to her and come every day to this house with a burden of firewood  then he did as he was told the woman bade him welcome and said: welcome to thee if it is the king that sent thee hither it is he truly said nera every day nera used to go with a burden of firewood to the dun he saw every day a blind man and a lame man on his neck coming out of the dun before him they would go until they were at the brink of a well before the dun is it there said the blind man it is indeed said the lame one let us go away said the lame man  nera then asked the woman about this why do the blind and the lame man visit the well they visit the crown which is in the well said the woman viz a diadem of gold which the king wears on his head it is there it is kept why do those two go said nera not hard to tell said she because it is they that are trusted by the king to visit the crown one of them was blinded the other lamed come hither a little said nera to his wife that thou mayst tell me of my adventures now what has appeared to thee said the woman not hard to tell said nera when i was going into the sid methought the rath of cruachan was destroyed and ailill and medb with their whole household had fallen in it that is not true indeed said the woman but an elfin host came to thee that will come true said she unless he would reveal it to his friends how shall i give warning to my people said nera rise and go to them said she they are still round the same cauldron and the charge has not yet been removed from the fire yet it had seemed to him three days and three nights since he had been in the sid tell them to be on their guard at halloween coming unless they come to destroy the sid for i will promise them this: the sid to be destroyed by ailill and medb and the crown of briun to be carried off by them  these are the three things which were found in it viz: the mantle of loegaire in armagh and the crown of briun in connaught and the shirt of dunlaing in leinster in kildare  how will it be believed of me that i have gone into the sid said nera take fruits of summer with thee said the woman then he took wild garlic with him and primrose and golden fern and i shall be pregnant by thee said she and shall bear thee a son and send a message from thee to the sid when thy people will come to destroy the sid that thou mayest take thy family and thy cattle from the sid  thereupon nera went to his people and found them around the same caldron and he related his adventures to them and then his sword was given to him and he staid with his people to the end of a year that was the very year in which fergus mac roich came as an exile from the land of ulster to ailill and medb to cruachan thy appointment has come oh nera said ailill to nera arise and bring thy people and thy cattle from the sid that we may go to destroy the sid  then nera went to his wife in the sid and she bade him welcome arise out to the dun now said the woman to nera and take a burden of firewood with thee i have gone to it for a whole year with a burden of firewood on my neck every day in thy stead and i said thou wert in sickness and there is also thy son yonder then he went out to the dun and carried a burden of firewood with him on his neck welcome alive from the sickness in which thou wast said the king i am displeased that the woman should sleep with thee without asking thy will shall be done about this said nera it will not be hard for thee said the king he went back to his house now tend thy kine today said the woman i gave a cow of them to thy son at once after his birth so nera went with his cattle that day  then while he was asleep the morrigan took the cow of his son and the donn of cualgne bulled her in the east in cualgne she the morrigan then went again westward with her cow cuchulaind overtook them in the plain of murthemne as they passed across it for it was one of cuchulainds gessa that even a woman should leave his land without his knowledge it was one of his gessa that birds should feed on his land unless they left something with him it was one of his gessa that fish should be in the bays unless they fell by him it was one of his gessa that warriors of another tribe should be in his land without his challenging them before morning if they came at night or before night if they came in the day every maiden and every single woman that was in ulster they were in his ward till they were ordained for husbands these are the gessa of cuchulaindl cuchulaind overtook the morrigan with her cow and he said: this cow must not be taken  nera went back then to his house with his kine in the evening the cow of my son is missing said he i did not deserve that thou shouldst go and tend kine in that way said his wife to him on that came the cow a wonder now whence does this cow come truly she comes from cualgne after being bulled by the donn of cualgne said the woman rise out now lest thy warriors come she said this host cannot go for a year till halloween next they will come on halloween next: for the fairymounds of erinn are always opened about halloween  nera went to his people whence comest thou said ailill and medb to nera and where hast thou been since thou didst go from us i was in fair lands said nera with great treasures and precious things with plenty of garments and food and of wonderful treasures they will come to slay you on halloween coming unless it had been revealed to you we shall certainly go against them said ailill so they remain there till the end of the year now if thou hast anything in the sid said ailill to nera bring it away so nera went on the third day before halloween and brought her drove out of the sid now as the bull calf went out of the sid viz the calf of the cow of aingene aingene was the name of his son it bellowed thrice at that same hour ailill and fergus were playing drafts when they heard something the bellowing of the bull calf in the plain then said fergus:  i like not the calf  bellowing in the plain of cruachan  the son of the black bull of cualgne which approaches  the young son of the bull from loch laig  there will be calves without cows  on bairche in cualgne  the king will go a    march through this calf of aingene  aingene was the name of the man and be aingeni the name of the woman and the appearance which this nera saw on them was the same as that which cuchulaind saw in the tain bo regamna  then the bull calf and the whitehorn meet in the plain of cruachan a night and a day they were there fighting until at last the bull calf was beaten then the bull calf bellowed when it was beaten what did the calf bellow medb asked of her neatherd whose name was buaigle i know that my good father fergus said bricriu it is the strain which thou sangest in the morning on that fergus glanced aside and struck with his fist at bricrius head so that the five men of the draftboard that were in his hand went into bricrius head and it was a lasting hurt to him tell me o buaigle what did the bull say said medb truly it said answered buaigle if its father came to tight with it viz the donn of cualgne it would not be seen in ai and it would be beaten throughout the whole plain of ai on every side then said medb in the manner of an oath: i swear by the gods that my people swear by that i shall not lie down nor sleep on down or flockbed nor shall i drink buttermilk nor nurse my side nor drink red ale nor white nor shall i taste food until i see those two kine fighting before my face  thereafter the men of connaught and the black host of exile went into the sid and destroyed the sid and took out what there was in it and then they brought away the crown of briun that is the third wonderful gift in erinn and the mantle of loegaire in armagh and the shirt of dunlaing in leinster in kildare nera was left with his people in the sid and has not come out until now nor will he come till doom
