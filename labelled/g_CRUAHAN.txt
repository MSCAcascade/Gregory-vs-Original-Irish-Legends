cruahan  now as to cruachan the home of ailell and of maeve it is on the plain of magh ai it was in the province of connaught  and this is the way the plain came by its name in the time long ago there was a king whose name was conn that had the druid power so that when the sidhe themselves came against him he was able to defend himself with enchantments as good as their own and one time he went out against them and broke up their houses and carried away their cattle and then to hinder them from following after him he covered the whole province with a deep snow  the sidhe went then to consult with dalach the kings brother that had the druid knowledge even better than himself and it is what he told them to do to kill three hundred white cows with red ears and to spread out their livers on a certain plain and when they had done this he made spells on them and the heat the livers gave out melted the snow over the whole plain and the whole province and after that the plain was given the name of magh ai the plain of the livers  ailell was son of ross ruadh king of leinster and maeve was daughter of eochaid king of ireland and her brothers were the three fair twins that rose up against    their father and fought against him at druim criadh and they were beaten in the fight and went back over the sionnan and they were overtaken and their heads were cut off and brought back to their father and he fretted after them to the end of his life  seven sons ailell and maeve had and the name of every one of them was maine there was maine mathremail like his mother and maine athremail like his father and maine mo epert the talker and maine milscothach the honeyworded and maine andoe the quick and maine mingor the gently dutiful and maine morgor the very dutiful their own people they had and their own place of living  this now was the appearance of cruachan the royal house of ailell and of maeve that some called cruachan of the poets there were seven divisions in the house with couches in them from the hearth to the wall a front of bronze to every division and of red yew with carvings on it and there were seven strips of bronze from the foundation to the roof of the house the house was made of oak and the roof was covered with oak shingles sixteen windows with glass there were and shutters of bronze on them and a bar of bronze across every shutter there was a raised place in the middle of the house for ailell and maeve with silver fronts and strips of bronze around it and four bronze pillars on it and a silver rod beside it the way ailell and maeve could strike the middle beam and check their people  and outside the royal house was the dun with the walls about it that were built by brocc son of blar and the great gate and it is there the houses were for strangers to be lodged  and besides this there was at cruachan the hill of the sidhe or as some called it the cave of cruachan it was there midhir brought etain one time and it is there    the people of the sidhe lived but it is seldom any living person had the power to see them  it is out of that hill a flock of white birds came one time and everything they touched in all ireland withered up until at last the men of ulster killed them with their slings and another time enchanted pigs came out of the hill and in every place they trod neither corn nor grass nor leaf would sprout before the end of seven years and no sort of weapon would wound them but if they were counted in any place or if the people so much as tried to count them they would not stop in that place but they would go on to another but however often the people of the country tried to count them no two people could ever make out the one number and one man would call out there are three pigs in it and another no but there are seven and another that it was eleven were in it or thirteen and so the count would be lost one time maeve and ailell themselves tried to count them on the plain but while they were doing it one of the pigs made a leap over maeves chariot and she in it every one called out a pig has gone over you maeve it has not she said and with that she caught hold of the pig by the shank but if she did its skin opened at the head and it made its escape and it is from that the place was called maghmucrimha the plain of swinecounting  another time fraech son of idath of the men of connaught that was son of boanns sister befind from the sidhe came to cruachan he was the most beautiful of the men of ireland or of alban but his life was not long it was to ask findabair for his wife he came and before he set out his people said: send a message to your mothers people the way they will send you clothing of the sidhe so he went to boann that was at magh breagh and he brought away fifty blue cloaks with four black ears on each cloak and a brooch of red gold    with each and pale white shirts with looped beasts of gold around them and fifty silver shields with edges and a candle of a kings house in the hand of each of the men knobs of carbuncle under them and their points of precious stones they used to light up the night as if they were suns rays  and he had with him seven trumpeters with gold and silver trumpets with many coloured clothing with golden silken heads of hair with coloured cloaks and three harpers with the appearance of a king on each of them every harper having the white skin of a deer about him and a cloak of white linen and a harpbag of the skins of waterdogs  the watchman saw them from the dun when they had come into the plain of cruachan i see a great crowd he said coming towards us since ailell was king and maeve was queen there never came and there never will come a grander or more beautiful crowd than this one it is like as if i had my head in a vat of wine with the breeze that goes over them  then fraechs people let out their hounds and the hounds found seven deer and seven foxes and seven hares and seven wild boars and hunted them to rath cruachan and there they were killed on the lawn of the dun  then ailell and maeve gave them a welcome and they were brought into the house and while food was being made ready maeve sat down to play a game of chess with fraech it was a beautiful chessboard they had all of white bronze and the chessmen of gold and silver and a candle of precious stones lighting them  then ailell said: let your harpers play for us while the feast is being made ready let them play indeed said fraech  so the harpers began to play and it was much that the people of the house did not die with crying and    with sadness and the music they played was the three cries of uaithne it was uaithne the harp of the dagda that first played those cries the time boanns sons were born the first was a song of sorrow for the hardness of her pains and the second was a song of smiling and joy for the birth of her sons and the third was a sleeping song after the birth  and with the music of the harpers and with the light that shone from the precious stones in the house they did not know the night was on them till at last maeve started up and she said: we have done a great deed to keep these young men without food it is more you think of chessplaying than of providing for them said ailell and now let them stop from the music he said till the food is given out  then the food was divided it was lothar used to be sitting on the floor of the house dividing the food with his cleaver and he not eating himself and from the time he began dividing food never failed under his hand  after that fraech was brought into the conversationhouse and they asked him what was it he wanted  a visit to yourselves he said but he said nothing of findabair so they told him he was welcome and he stopped with them for a while and every day they went out hunting and all the people of connaught used to come and to be looking at them  but all this time fraech got no chance of speaking with findabair until one morning at daybreak he went down to the river for washing and findabair and her young girls had gone there before him and he took her hand and he said: stay here and talk with me for it is for your sake i am come and would you go away with me secretly i will not go secretly she said for i am the daughter of a king and of a queen    so she went from him then but she left him a ring to remember her by it was a ring her mother had given her  then fraech went to the conversationhouse to ailell and to maeve will you give your daughter to me he said we will give her if you will give the marriage portion we ask said ailell and that is sixty blackgrey horses with golden bits and twelve milch cows and a white redeared calf with each of them and you to come with us with all your strength and all your musicians at whatever time we go to war in ulster i swear by my shield and my sword i would not give that for maeve herself he said and he went away out of the house  but ailell had taken notice of findabairs ring with fraech and he said to maeve: if he brings our daughter away with him we will lose the help of many of the kings of ireland let us go after him and make an end of him before he has time to harm us that would be a pity said maeve and it would be a reproach on us it will be no reproach on us the way i will manage it said he and maeve agreed to it for there was vexation on her that it was findabair that fraech wanted and not herself so they went into the palace and ailell said: let us go and see the hounds hunting until midday so they did so and at midday they were tired and they all went to bathe in the river and fraech was swimming in the river and ailell said to him: do not come back till you bring me a branch of the rowantree there beyond with the beautiful berries for he knew there was a prophecy that it was in a river fraech would get his death  so he went and broke a branch off the tree and brought it back over the water and it is beautiful he looked over the black water his body without fault    and his face so nice and his eyes very grey and the branch with the red berries between the throat and white face and then he threw the branch to them out of the water it is ripe and beautiful the berries are said ailell bring us more of them  so he went off again to the tree and the waterworm guarded the tree caught a hold of him let me have a sword called out but there was not a man on the land would dare to give it to him through fear of ailell and of maeve but findabair made a leap to go into the water with a gold knife she had in her hand but ailell threw a sharppointed spear from above through her plaited hair that held her but she threw the knife to fraech and he cut off the head of the monster and brought it with him to land but he himself had got a deep wound then ailell and maeve went back to the house it is a great deed we have done said maeve it is a pity indeed what we have done to the man said ailell and let a healingbath be made for him now he said of the marrow of pigs and of a heifer fraech was put in the bath then and pleasant music was played by the trumpeters and a bed was made for him  then a sorrowful crying was heard on cruachan and they saw three times fifty women with purple gowns with green headdresses and pins of silver on their wrists and a messenger went and i asked them who was it they were crying for for fraech son of idath they said boy darling of the king of the sidhe of ireland  then fraech heard their crying and he said: lift me out of this for that is the cry of my mother and of the women of boann so they lifted him out and the women came round him and brought him away into the hill of cruachan  and the next day he came out and he whole and    sound and fifty women with him and they with the appearance of women of the sidhe and at the door of the dun they left him and they gave out their cry again so that all the people that heard it could not but feel sorrowful it is from this the musicians of ireland learned the sorrowful cry of the women of the sidhe  and when he went into the house the whole household rose up before him and bade him welcome as if it was from another world he was come and there was shame and repentance on ailell and on maeve for trying to harm him and peace was made and he went away to his own place  and it was after that he came to help ailell and maeve and that he got his death in a river as was foretold at the beginning of the war for the brown bull of cuailgne  and one time the hill was robbed by the men of cruachan and this is the way it happened  one night at samhain ailell and maeve were in cruachan with their whole household and the food was being made ready  two prisoners had been hanged by them the day before and ailell said: whoever will put a gad round the foot of either of the two men on the gallows will get a prize from me  it was a very dark night and bad things would always appear on that night of samhain and every man that went out to try came back very quickly into the house i will go if i will get a prize said nera then i will give you this goldhilted sword said ailell  so nera went out and he put a gad round the foot of one of the men that had been hanged then the man spoke to him it is good courage you have he said and bring me with you where i can get a drink for i was very thirsty when i was hanged so nera brought him where he would get a drink and then he    put him on the gallows again and went back to cruachan  but what he saw was the whole of the palace as if on fire before him and the heads of the people of it lying on the ground and then he thought he saw an army going into the hill of cruachan and he followed after the army there is a man on our track the last man said the track is the heavier said the next to him and each said that word to the other from the last to the first then they went into the hill of cruachan and they said to their king: what shall be done to the man that is come in let him come here till i speak with him said the king so nera came and the king asked him who it was had brought him in i came in with your army said nera go to that house beyond said the king: there is a woman there will make you welcome tell her it is i myself sent you to her and come every day he said to this house with a load of firing  so nera went where he was told and the woman said: a welcome before you if it is the king sent you so he stopped there and took the woman for his wife and every day for three days he brought a load of firing to the kings house and on each day he saw a blind man and a lame man on his back coming out of the house before him they would go on till they were at the brink of a well before the hill is it there the blind man would say it is indeed the lame man would say let us go away the lame man would say then  and at the end of three days as he thought nera asked the woman about this why do the blind man and the lame man go every day to the well he said they go to know is the crown safe that is in the well it is there the kings crown is kept why do these two go said nera it is easy to tell that she said they are trusted by the king to visit the crown and    one of them was blinded by him and the other was lamed and another thing she said go now and give a warning to your people to mind themselves next samhain night unless they will come to attack the hill for it is only at samhain she said the army of the sidhe can go out for it is at that time all the hills of the sidhe of ireland are opened but if they will come i will promise them this the crown of briun to be carried off by ailell and by maeve  how can i give them that message said nera when i saw the whole dun of cruachan burned and destroyed and all the people destroyed with it you did not see that indeed she said it was the host of the sidhe came and put that appearance before your eyes and go back to them now she said and you will find them sitting round the same great pot and the meat has not yet been taken off the fire  how will it be believed that i have gone into the hill said nera bring flowers of summer with you said the woman so he brought wild garlic with him and primroses and golden fern  so he went back to the palace and he found his people round the same great pot and he told them all that had happened him and the sword was given to him and he stopped with his people to the end of a year  at the end of the year ailell said to nera: we are going now against the hill of the sidhe and let you go back he said if you have anything to bring out of it so he went back to see the woman and she bade him welcome go now she said and bring in a load of firing to the king for i went in myself every day for the last year with the load on my back and i said there was sickness on you so he did that  then the men of connaught and the black host of the exiles of ulster went into the hill and robbed it and brought away the crown of briun son of smetra that    was made by the smith of angus son of umor and that was kept in the well at cruachan to save it from the morrigu and nera was left with his people in the hill and he has not come out till now and he will not come out till the end of life and time  now one time the morrigu brought away a cow from the hill of cruachan to the brown bull of cuailgne and after she brought it back again its calf was born and one day it went out of the hill and it bellowed three times at that time ailell and fergus were playing draughts for it was after fergus had come as an exile from ulster because of the death of the sons of usnach and they heard the bellowing of the bullcalf in the plain then fergus said: i do not like the sound of the calf bellowing there will be calves without cows he said when the king goes on his march  but now ailells bull finbanach the whitehorned met the calf in the plain of cruachan and they fought together and the calf was beaten and it bellowed what did the calf bellow maeve asked her cowherd buaigle i know that my master fergus said bricriu it is the song that you were singing a while ago on that fergus turned and struck with his fist at his head so that the five men of the chessmen that were in his hand went into bricrius head and it was a lasting hurt to him tell me now buaigle what did the calf bellow said maeve it said indeed said buaigle that if its father the brown bull of cuailgne would come to fight with the whitehorned he would not be seen any more in ai he would be beaten through the whole plain of ai on every side and it is what maeve said: i swear by the gods my people swear by i will not lie down on feathers or drink red or white ale till i see those two bulls fighting before my face
