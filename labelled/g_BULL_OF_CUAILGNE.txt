the war for the bull of cuailgne  it happened one time before maeve and ailell rose up from their royal bed in cruachan they began to talk with one another it is what i am thinking said ailell it is a true saying good is the wife of a good man a true saying indeed said maeve but why do you bring it to mind at this time i bring it to mind now because you are better today than the day i married you i was good before i ever had to do with you said maeve how well we never heard of that and never knew it until now said ailell but only that you stopped at home like any other woman while the enemies at your boundaries were slaughtering and destroying and driving all before them and you not able to hinder them that is not the way it was at all said maeve but of the six daughters of my father eochaid king of ireland i was the best and the one that was thought most of as to dividing gifts and giving counsel i was the best of them and as to battle feats and arms and fighting i was the best of them it was i had fifteen hundred soldiers sons of exiles and fifteen hundred sons of chief men and i had these she said for my own household and along with that my father gave me one of the provinces of ireland the province of cruachan so that maeve of cruachan is the name that was given to me    and as to being asked in marriage she said messengers came to me from your own brother finn son of ross ruadh king of leinster and i gave him a refusal and after that there came messengers from cairbre niafer son of rossa king of teamhair and from conchubar son of ness king of ulster and after that again from eochu beag son of luchta and i refused them all for it is not a common marriage portion would have satisfied me the same as is asked by the other women of ireland she said but it is what i asked as a marriage portion a man without stinginess without jealousy without fear for it would not be fitting for me to be with a man that would be closehanded for my own hand is open in wagepaying and in freegiving and it would be a reproach on my husband i to be a better wagepayer than himself and it would not be fitting for me to be with a man that would be cowardly for i myself go into struggles and fights and battles and gain the victory and it would be a reproach to my husband his wife to be braver than himself and it would not be fitting for me to be with a husband that would be jealous for i was never without one man being with me in the shadow of another now i have got such a husband as i looked for in yourself ailell for you are not closehanded or jealous or cowardly and i gave you good wedding gifts she said suits of clothing enough for twelve men a chariot that was worth three times seven servingmaids the width of your face in red gold the round of your arm in a bracelet of white bronze and the fine or the tribute you can ask of your enemies is no more than the fine or the tribute i have a right to ask for you are nothing of yourself but it is in the pay of a woman you are she said that is not so said ailell for i am a kings son and i have two brothers that are kings finn king of leinster and cairbre king of tara and i    would have been king in their places but that they are older than myself and as to giving of wages and dividing of gifts he said you are no better than myself and if this province is under the rule of a woman it is the only province in ireland that is so and it is not through your right i took the kingship of it but through the right of my mother mata of murrisk daughter of magach and if i took the daughter of the chief king of ireland for my wife it was because i thought she was a fitting wife for me you know well said maeve the riches that belong to me are greater than the riches that belong to you that is a wonder to me said ailell for there is no one in ireland has a better store of jewels and riches and treasure than myself and you know well there is not  let our goods and our riches be put beside one another and let a value be put on them said maeve and you will know which of us owns most i am content to do that said ailell  with that orders were given to their people to bring out their goods and to count them and to put a value on them they did so and the first things they brought out were their drinking vessels their vats their iron vessels and all the things belonging to their households and they were found to be equal then their rings were brought out and their bracelets and chains and brooches their clothing of crimson and blue and black and green and yellow and saffron and speckled silks and these were found to be equal then their great flocks of sheep were driven from the green plains of the open country and were counted and they were found to be equal and if there was a ram among maeves flocks that was the equal of a servingmaid in value ailell had one that was as good and their horses were brought in from the meadows and their herds of swine out of the woods and the valleys and they were equal one to    another and the last thing that was done was to bring in the herds of cattle from the forest and the wild places of the province and when they were put beside one another they were found to be equal but for one thing only it happened a bull had been calved in maeves herd and his name was fionnbanach the whitehorned but he would not stop in maeves herds for he did not think it fitting to be under the rule of a woman and he had gone into ailells herds and stopped there and now he was the best bull in the whole province of connaught and when maeve saw him and knew he was better than any bull of her own there was great vexation on her and it was as bad to her as if she did not own one head of cattle at all so she called mac roth the herald to her and bade him to find out where there was a bull as good as the whitehomed to be got in any province of the provinces of ireland  i myself know that well said mac roth for there is a bull hat is twice as good as himself at the house of daire son of fachtna in the district of cuailgne and that is donn cuailgne the brown bull of cuailgne rise up then said maeve and make no delay but go to daire from me and ask the loan of that bull for a year and i will return him at the end of the year and fifty heifers along with him as fee for the loan and there is another thing for you to say mac roth if the people of daires district and country think bad of him for sending away that wonderful jewel the donn of cuailgne let daire himself come along with him and i will give him the equal of his own lands on the smooth plain of ai and a chariot that is worth three times seven servingmaids and my own close friendship along with that  so mac roth set out on his journey and nine men along with him and when they came to daires house there was a good welcome before them as there    should be for mac roth was the chief herald of all ireland  daire asked him then what was the reason of his journey and mac roth told him the whole story of the quarrel between maeve and ailell and of the counting of their herds and of the great rewards maeve offered him if he would give her the loan for one year of the brown bull of cuailgne daire was so well pleased when he heard this that he  started up and said: i will send him to maeve into connaught whether the men of ulster like it or do not like it mac roth was well content with that and he and his men were attended to and fresh rushes were spread and a feast was put before them with every sort of food and of drink so that after a while they were so clear in their wits as they were before  two of them began talking to one another then and one said: this is a good man in whose house we are he is good indeed said the other is there any man in ulster better than himself said the first there is surely said the other for conchubar the high king is a better man and it is no shame for all the men of ulster to gather to him it is a wonder said the first daire to have given up to us what it would have taken the strength of the four provinces of ireland to bring away by force that i may see the mouth that spoke those words filled with blood said another of the men for if daire had refused to give it willingly the strength of ailell and of maeve and the knowledge of fergus son of rogh would have brought it from him against his will  just as they were talking the chief steward of daires house came in and servants along with him bringing meat and drink and he heard what the men of connaught said and great anger came on him and he    bade the servants put down the food for them but he never told them to use it or not to use it but he went to where daire was and said: was it you daire promised the brown bull of cuailgne to these messengers it was myself indeed said daire then what they have said is true what is that said daire they say that you knew if you did not give him willingly you would have had to give him against your will by the strength of ailell and maeve and by the guidance of fergus son of rogh if they say that said daire i swear by the gods my people swear by that they will not take him away till they take him by force  on the morning of the morrow the messengers rose up and went into the house where daire was show us now they said the place where the bull is i will not indeed said daire but if it was a habit with me he said to do treachery to messengers or to travellers or to men on their road not one of you would go back alive to cruachan what reason have you for this change said mac roth i have a good reason for it for you were saying last night that if i did not give the bull willingly i would be forced to give it against my will by ailell and by maeve and by fergus if that was said it was the talk of common messengers and they after eating and drinking said mac roth and it is not fitting for you to take notice of a thing like that  it may be so said daire but for all that he said i will not give the bull this time  they went back then to cruachan and maeve asked news of them and mac roth told her the whole story how daire gave them the promise of the bull at first and refused it afterwards what was the reason of that she asked and when it was told her she said: this riddle is not hard to guess they did not intend to let    us get the bull at all but now we will take him from them by force she said  and this was the cause of the great war for the brown bull of cuailgne     then maeve sent messengers to the six maines her sons to come to cruachan the brothers of maine morgor that got his death at dun gerg and she sent messengers to the sons of magach and they came with thirty hundred armed men and to cormac conloingeas son of king conchubar and to fergus son of rogh and they came and thirty hundred armed men with them  this is the appearance that was on the first troop black heads of hair they had and green cloaks about them held with silver brooches and on their bodies shirts of gold thread embroidered with red gold and they had swords with white sheaths and hilts of silver  as to the second troop they had shortcut hair and grey cloaks about them and on their bodies pure white shirts and they had swords with knobbed hilts of gold and sheaths of silver every one asked: is that cormac among them it is not indeed said maeve  as to the last troop they had goldyellow hair falling loose like manes and crimson cloaks well ornamented about them and gold brooches with jewels at their breasts and long silk shirts coming down to their ankles and as they walked they lifted up their feet and put them down again all together is that cormac among them every one asked it is surely said maeve  so they made their camp there and between the four fords of ai athmaga athslisen athberena and athcoltna there were red fires blazing through the night    paragraph continues and they stopped a fortnight there at cruachan eating drinking and resting themselves that they might be the better able for the journey and the marching  then maeve bade her chariotdriver to yoke her horses that she might go and consult with her druid and ask a prophecy from him to foretell for her if the army she was bringing out would get the victory and would come back safely and she said to the druid: there are many that will part here today from their companions and their friends from their country and their lands from their father and their mother and if it happens that the whole of them do not come back again safe and sound it is on me the complaints and the curses will fall and besides that she said there is no one that goes out or that stops behind that is dearer to us than we are to ourselves so find out for us now whether we shall return or not return and the druid said: whoever returns or does not return you yourself will return  her chariot was turned then and she went back again homeward but presently she saw a thing she wondered at a woman sitting on the shaft of the chariot facing her and this is how she was: a sword of white bronze in her hand with seven rings of red gold on it and she seemed to be weaving a web with it a speckled green cloak about her fastened at the breast with a brooch of red gold a ruddy pleasant face she had her eyes grey and her mouth like red berries and when she spoke her voice was sweeter than the strings of a curved harp and her skin showed through her clothes like the snow of a single night long feet she had very whit and the nails on them pink and even her hair goldyellow three locks of it wound about her head and another that fell down loose below her knee  maeve looked at her and she said: what are you doing here young girl it is looking into the future    for you i am she said to see what will be your chances and your fortunes now you are gathering the provinces of ireland to the war for the brown bull of cuailgne and why would you be doing this for me said maeve there is good reason for it she said for i am a servingmaid of your own people which of my people do you belong to said maeve i am fedelm of the sidhe of rath cruachan it is well fedelm of the sidhe tell me what way you see our hosts i see crimson on them i see red yet conchubar is lying in his weakness at emain my messengers are come back from there and we need not be in dread of anything from ulster said maeve but look again fedelm of the sidhe and tell me the truth of the matter i see crimson on them i see red said the girl yet eoghan son of durthacht is in his weakness at rathairthir my messengers are come back from him we need not be afraid of anything from ulster look again fedelm of the sidhe how do you see our hosts i see them all crimson i see them all red celtchair son of uthecar is lying in his weakness within his fort my messengers are come back from him tell me again fedelm of the sidhe how do you see our hosts i see crimson on them i see red there may be no harm in what you see said maeve for when all the men of ireland are gathered together in one place there will surely be quarrels and fights among them about going first or last over fords and rivers or about the first wounding of some stag or boar or such like tell me truly now fedelm of the sidhe what way do you see our hosts i see crimson on them i see red and i see she said a lowsized man doing many deeds of arms there are many wounds on his smooth skin there is a light about his head there is victory on his forehead he is young and beautiful and modest towards women but he is like a dragon in the    battle his appearance and his courage are like the appearance and the courage of cuchulain of muirthemne and who that hound from muirthemne may be i do not know but i know this much well that all this host will be reddened by him he is setting out for the battle he will make your dead lie thickly the memory of the blood shed by him will be lasting women will be keening over the bodies brought low by the hound of the forge that i see before me  this is the foretelling that was made for maeve by fedelm of the sidhe before the setting out of the hosts at cruachan for ulster     now when maeve told fedelm of the sidhe that there need be no fear of the men of ulster coming out to attack the army for they were lying in their weakness she meant that they were under the curse and the enchantment that was put on them one time by a woman they had illtreated and the story of it is this:  there was a man of the name of crunden son of agnoman that lived in a lonely part of ulster among the mountains and he had a good way of living but his wife had died and he had the care of all his children on him one day he was sitting in the house and he saw a woman come in at the door tall and handsome and with good clothes on her and she did not say a word but she sat down by the hearth and began to make up the fire and then she went to where the meal was and took it out and mixed it and baked a cake and when the evening was drawing on she took a vessel and went out and milked the cows but all the time she never spoke a word then she came back into the house and took a turn to the right and was the last to stop up and to cover over the fire  she stayed on there and crunden the man of the    house married her and she tended him and his sons and everything he had prospered  it happened one day there was to be a great gathering of the men of ulster for games and races and all sorts of amusements and all that could go both of men and women used to go to that gathering i will go there today said crunden the same as every other man is going do not said his wife for if you so much as say my name there at the fair she said i will be lost to you for ever then indeed i will not speak of you at all said crunden so he set out with the others to the fair and there was every sort of amusement there and all the people of the country were at it  at the ninth hour the royal chariot was brought on the ground and the kings horses won the day then the bards and poets and the druids and the servants of the king and the whole gathering began to praise the king and the queen and their horses and they cried out: there were never seen such horses as these there are no better runners in all ireland my wife is a better runner than those two horses said crunden when the king was told of that he said: take hold of the man and keep him until his wife can be brought to try her chance and to run against the horses  so they took hold of him and kept him and messengers were sent from the king to the woman she bade the messengers welcome and asked what brought them we are come by the kings order they said to bring you to the fair to see if you will run faster than the kings horses for your husband boasted that you would and he is kept prisoner now until you will come and release him it is foolish my husband was to speak like that she said and as for myself i am not fit to go for i am soon going to give birth to a child that is a pity said the messengers for if you    do not come your husband will be put to death if that is so i must go whatever happens she said  so with that she set out for the gathering and when she got there all the people were crowding about her to see her it is not fitting to be looking at me and i the way i am she cried and what have i been brought here for to run against the two horses of the king the people called out ochone she said do not ask me for i am close upon my hour take out your swords and put the man to death said the king give me your help she said to the people for every one of you has been born of a mother and then she said to the king: give me even a delay until my child is born i will give no delay said the king then the shame that is on you will be greater than the shame that is on me she said and because you have showed no pity and no respect to me she said it is a heavier punishment will fall on you than has fallen upon me and bring out the horses beside me now then they started and the woman outran the horses and gained the race and at the goal the pains of childbirth came on her and she bore two children a boy and a girl and she gave a great cry in her pain  and a weakness came suddenly on all that heard the cry so that they had no more strength than the woman as she lay there and it is what she said: from this out and till the ninth generation the shame that you have put on me will fall on you and at whatever time you most want your strength at the time your enemies are closing on you that is the time the weakness of a woman in childbirth will come upon all men of the province of ulster  and so it happened and of all the men of ulster that were born after that day there was no one escaped that curse and that enchantment but only cuchulain    when the men of connaught set out from cruachan for the north they stopped towards evening at cuilsilinne and there they made their encampment for the night ailell took his place in the middle of the camp and on his right was fergus son of rogh and cormac conloingeas next to him again and their people on the same side and on ailells left there was a place made for maeve and findabair her daughter but maeve stopped behind until the whole of the army had come up and then she went in her chariot to see if all was in order and after that she came and took her seat at ailells right hand which of the troops do you think the best said ailell none of them are any good at all said maeve compared with the men of leinster the gailiana what have they done beyond all the others that you praise them so much said ailell there is reason for praising them said maeve for while the others were choosing a place for themselves the gailiana had their huts and their shelters made and while the others were making their shelters they had their share of food and drink cooked and set out and while the others were making ready their food they had theirs eaten and while the others were eating they were laid down and sleeping and as their servants have been better than the servants of the men of ireland she said so will their young men and their fighting men be better than the young men of ireland on this march i am well pleased to hear that said ailell for it was with me they came and they are of my own province then you need not be so well pleased said maeve for they shall march no further with you for i will not have them boasted of before me or to me let them stop in this camp then said ailell they shall not do that either said maeve what must they do then said findabair if they are neither to go on nor to stop in the camp they will get death and    destruction from myself said maeve it is a pity you to say that said ailell and they only just after joining us if you think to harm them said fergus you will have to fight with me as well as with them for by the oath of my people he said it is only over my body and the bodies of men of ulster that are with me you can come at their death not speak that way fergus said maeve for if you were to with these strangers against me i would have the six maines and their men on my side and the sons of magach and their men my own troops along with them and i think we would be well for you she said it is not right for you to say that said fergus for there are no men in ireland better than the young men of ulster that came to connaught with me and they have been a help to you up to this but i will tell you another thing to do he said: let the men of leinster be divided through all the other of the men of ireland the way there will not be more than of them together in any one place i will agree to that said maeve for i know there would be nothing but fighting and jealousy if they were left together the way they are now  on the morning of the morrow they made ready to set out again but the chief men among them consulted together first what way they could best keep the peace between so many troops and tribes and families and it is what they settled to put every troop under its own leader and to let it great or small take a road of its own and besides that they consulted who would be the best man to put over the whole army to lead them and to show them the way and they all said fergus would be the best for he had been king of ulster seventeen years until conchubar put him out of the kingship and he had stopped on in ulster after that until the time conchubar killed the sons of usnach in spite of the guarantee he had given them    so fergus was made leader of the whole army but as they went on a great love for his own province and his home came on him and instead of going on northwards he turned to the south and while he was delaying the army like that he sent messengers into ulster to give warning and news of their coming but maeve was keeping a watch on him and when she saw what had happened she went to him and said: why is it fergus that we have turned again to the south then fergus knew it was no use to try and deceive her and they turned again but they did not go far but only to the place they had left in the morning cuilsilinne  then fergus called to mind that they were coming near the borders of ulster and that it was likely it would not be long before they would meet with cuchulain and he gave a warning to the army to mind themselves well lest the hound of muirthemne should fall on them angry and beautiful and destroy them  and then the men of connaught set out again eastward and when they came to monecolthan they saw before them eightscore deer in the one herd and the whole army surrounded them and all the deer were killed but if they were it was the gailiana scattered as they were that killed all the deer but five and those five were all that were killed by the rest of the men of ireland  it was on that same day cuchulain and his father sualtim came to the pillarstone at ardcullin for they had got the warning fergus had sent and there they let their horses graze and sualtims horses cropped the grass to the north of the pillarstone to the earth but cuchulains horses at the south side cropped it to the bare flags  it is in my mind sualtim said cuchulain that the army of connaught is not far away from us now go now then he said and bring a warning to the    men of ulster and tell them not to stop in the open plains but to go into the woods and the valleys of the province that the men of ireland may not come upon them and you yourself little son what will you do said sualtim i must go said cuchulain southward to teamhair for i promised to go there today to see a young girl of the household of fedelm of the fair shape laegaires wife it is a pity for you to go for a thing like that said sualtim and you leaving ulster under the feet of enemies and strangers i must go indeed said cuchulain for if i break my word to a woman it will be said from this out that a womans word is better than a mans  so sualtim set out then to give a warning to the men of ulster and cuchulain went into the oak woods and cut down an oak sapling and twisted it into a ring and cut a message on it in ogham and then he forced the ring over the top of the pillarstone and down to the thick part of it and then he went on to keep his appointment at teamhair  as to the men of ireland they went on till they came to ardcullin and the whole country of ulster lay there before them and then they saw the pillarstone and the oak ring that was on it and ailell took it off and gave it to fergus and bade him read the ogham and what he read on it was cuchulains name and the warning on it that the men of ulster should not pass the pillarstone that night for if they did he would go a great revenge on them at the sunrise of the morrow  it would be a pity said maeve that the first blood to be shed after going into the province should be the blood of our own people: it would be best for us to draw blood first on the people of ulster i agree to that said ailell for i am loth to go against this ring or the man that twisted it but let us go into the wood and our camp there for the night so they went    into the wood cut a way for the chariots with their swords as they went and it is from that the place is called sleact na gearbat the cut way of the chariots until this time and a great snow fell that night so it made one plain of the five provinces of ireland and they could make no shelter or prepare food and none of the men in the camp knew through the whole night was it friend or enemy was near him until the clear light of the sun fell on the snow in the morning and then they left that place and went on into ulster  as to cuchulain he did not rise very early that morning and he did there was food made ready for him and a bath of pure water then he bade laeg to make his chariot ready and they set out and after a while they came to the track of the army of ireland where it had gone over the border into ulster well laeg said cuchulain i have not much luck out of my appointment that i kept last night for it is expected of one that is watching the borders that the least he should do is to raise a cry or give a warning of the enemy that is coming and i have missed doing this so that the men of ireland have slipped by without news or notice into ulster i told you cuchulain said laeg that if you kept to your meeting last night some vexation like this would fall on you well laeg said cuchulain let you follow their track now and count them and see what number of the men of ireland are come over the border laeg did this and he came back and told their number as he had counted them there is a mistake in your counting said cuchulain i will count them myself this time then he told their number it is with yourself the mistake is cuchulain said laeg it is not he said but there are eighteen divisions have passed the border but the eighteenth is broken up and distributed among the others so that no sure reckoning can be made of it    this now was one of the three best estimates ever made in ireland and the other two were made by lugh of the long hand and by angus at brugh na boinne  but now laeg he said turn the chariot towards the army and hurry on the horses for unless i can make an end of some of them today he said i will not live through the night myself  so they went on to the place that is called now athgowla northward from knowth  there they met with the two young men the sons of neara that were sent out in front of maeves army to see was there any hindrance before it and cuchulain struck off their heads and the heads of their chariotdrivers  and he cut down a tree with his sword and it having four branches and he lopped them short and cleared the tree and he stood up in his chariot and with one cast he drove the tree into the ground that it stood deep and firm and he set the four heads he had struck off on the four lopped branches of it and then he turned back their horses in their chariots towards the army  now it is the way maeve used to be going she in a chariot by herself and two chariots on each side of her and behind her and before her the way no sod from the feet of the horses of the army or foam from their mouths would touch her clothing and when she saw the two chariots coming back and the bodies in them without heads she stopped to see what had happened what are these she said they are the chariots and the bodies of the two sons of neara that went on before us said her chariotdriver  then she held a council with her chief men and it is what they agreed that it must be some part of the army of ulster was there before them at the ford they were drawing near and that it was best to send out    paragraph continues cormac conloingeas and his men to see who was in it for the men of ulster would not be willing to harm the son of their high king  so cormac and his troop went on to the ford but when he got there all he saw was a lopped tree and four heads on it and the blood dripping down from them and the track of one chariot only going eastward out of the ford then the rest of the army came with the other chief men there is wonder on me said ailell our four men to have been made an end of so easily as this you may wonder as well said fergus at the way this pole was driven into the ground by one man and it will be hard for you to find a man of your army will drag it out again do it yourself fergus said maeve for you are of my army so fergus called for a chariot and stood up in it and gave such a strong pull at the pole that the chariot broke under him give me another chariot he said and when he had broken seventeen of the warchariots of connaught one after another and had not so much as loosened the pole maeve said: leave off now fergus from breaking my peoples chariots and if you yourself had not been with us on this march she said we would have been up with the men of ulster before now and we would have taken men and cattle and i know well why you did this it was to give the men of ulster time to get over their weakness and their pains and to come out against us to defend their bull and their cattle give me my own chariot then said fergus so they gave him his own chariot and he got up in it and gave a great pull at the pole and neither the frame nor the wheels of his chariot started or strained like the others and he pulled up the pole and gave it into ailells hand and ailell looked at it and said: there is dread on me of the man that set that pole there do you think fergus he said was it conchubar the high king that did    it it was not said fergus for if conchubar had come here his army would have come along with him and all the men of ulster and he would not have been so near to you without offering you battle and by this time whichever got the better would be boasting of it do you think was it cuscraid conchubars son said ailell or eoghan son of durthacht king of fernmaighe or celthair son of uthecar i do not said fergus but it is what i think that it was my own fosterson and conchubars that was here cuchulain son of sualtim we heard you often talking at cruachan about that young man and what is his age at this time his age is of no great matter said fergus for he did great deeds when he was but a soft child he is young enough yet said maeve and i think it will not be hard to find some one of our own men that will get the better of this wild hound fir he has but the one body to wound or to put to flight you will get no one said fergus among your fighting men and your young men and your champions that will be able to put down cuchulain  they stopped there then and made their camp and rested that night with food and with music  and it was in that night fergus gave maeve and ailell the whole story of the boy deeds of cuchulain and how he used to have a stone for a pillow and no one dared wake him lest he might chance to give them a blow of the stone in his anger and he told of one night when he was asleep and conchubar was attacked and was beaten by eoghan son of durthact and cuchulain was awakened by the cries of the beaten men that were running away and he went out in the darkness of the night to look for conchubar and where the battle had been he saw a man with the half of a mans body on his back and he called to    cuchulain to help him and threw the halfbody to him and cuchulain threw it back again and they fought and he struck off the mans head and then he found conchubar lying in a grave and he dug him out of that and as they went home they met cuscraid that was wounded and cuchulain brought him home to emain on his back and another time he went into a wood and saw a terriblelooking man having a wild boar in one hand and his weapon in the other hand and he killed him and brought home the boar and another time when the men of ulster were in their weakness three times nine searobbers came to emain and the women ran shrieking to the palace when they saw them and when the boys that were at play on the lawn knew what they were running from they ran along with them but cuchulain went out and killed nine of the searobbers and wounded the rest of them so that he drove them all back and he told them many other stories of his doings beside these     the next day the army marched on eastward beyond the mountain but there was a narrow place they had to pass through and cuchulain cut down a great oak tree and laid it across the gap and wrote an ogham on it and when the men of ireland came up to it it hindered them and they could not move it and they made their camp there that night and early in the morning they sent the young man fraech son of idath to get the hindrance cleared away but fraech went on beyond it till he came to a river and there he found cuchulain bathing and they attacked one another in the water and fraech was beaten and cuchulain went away and left his body on the bank  and when the men of ireland found his body they began to keen him and then they saw a great band of women of the sidhe with green dresses on them    coming for his body and they gave out a great cry over him and brought him away to a hill of the sidhe and findabair cried after him and went to see the green bank where he was lying  and they knew that cuchulain was not far from them for presently maeves little dog baiscne got his death by a stone from a sling there was anger on maeve then and she urged her men to follow after cuchulain so that they broke the poles of their chariots in their hurry  the next day cuchulain was going through the wood and he heard the sound of blows on the trees it is too bold the men of ulster are laeg he said to be cutting down trees like this with the men of ireland coming on them and stop here he said till i find out who is it that is in the wood  he went on till he met with a young man of connaught that was chariotdriver to orlam son of maeve and ailell what is it you are doing there young man he asked i am cutting holly poles said the young man for we have broken our chariots hunting that notable deer cuchulain and now good friend he said lend me a hand with these poles lest that same notable cuchulain should come upon me here your choice boy shall i cut the holly poles or shall i trim them for you let you do the trimming said he so cuchulain took them and trimmed them straight and smooth that a fly could not have kept his footing on them the chariotdriver looked at the poles and he said: i am thinking this is not the work you have a right to be put to and who are you at all he said i am that notable cuchulain you were speaking of just now that is bad news for me said the driver for surely i am a dead man there need be no fear on you said cuchulain for i do not fight against drivers or messengers or unarmed men but    where is your master he said he is out before you on the plain go to him then and give him this warning that i am here and that if we meet he will surely get his death from me with that the young man went to look for his master but quick as he went cuchulain was quicker and as soon as he came up with orlam he struck off his head and held it up and shook it before the men of ireland  after that the three sons of garach came out and made an attack on him but he overcame them and struck off their heads and he killed their chariotdrivers as well that they had armed against him and lethan and his chariotdriver came against him and he killed them in the same way  at that time the harpers of cainbile came to maeves camp and played on their magic harps but the men of ireland thought it might be as spies they came and they drove them out of the camp and followed after them till they came to the great stone of lecmore but when they thought to overtake them there the harpers took on themselves the shape of wild deer and went away and it was on the same day that cuchulain with two casts of a sling stone killed the marten and the pet bird that were sitting on maeves two shoulders  then the men of ireland came into magh breagh and muirthemne and carried off and destroyed all before them and fergus warned them that cuchulain was not far off and that he would do a great vengeance on them since they had spoiled muirthemne and it was at that time lugaid son of nois that had gone into connaught with fergus went secretly to cuchulain and told him of all that was going on in the camp and of the dread of him that was on all the men of ireland so that they did not dare to stir out alone and that he himself was true to him yet  and now that the army was coming so near to    cuailgne the wargoddess the battle crow the morrigu came and sat on a pillarstone at teamhair and gave a warning to the brown bull of cuailgne and it is what she said have a care and keep a good watch my poor bull or the men of ireland will come on you and will drive you away to their camp and when the bull heard the warning he brought fifty of his heifers with him and went away to a valley of slieve cuilinn  and the men of ireland came on bringing the herds of cattle they took on the way where there was no one to defend them and they stopped for the night at conaille muirthemne and there maeve bade one of her women go down to the stream for water and the woman was wearing maeves golden covering on her head and cuchulain saw her and he thought it was maeve herself that was in it and he made a cast of a stone that killed her and the gold covering was broken in pieces  and they were delayed there for a while for the river was in flood and when they tried to cross it the chariots that went in were swept away to the sea and one of maeves best men uala that she sent to try the depth of it was swept away along with them and while they were stopping there cuchulain killed raen and rae that were come to tell the story of the war and a hundred men along with them  then maeve said: some man of you must go out and stand against cuchulain to save the army it is not i that will go said one of them it is not i said all the others for cuchulain is no easy man to stand against and they were for going round by the head of the river but maeve made them cut a way through the mountain before them that it might be left as a lasting disgrace to ulster so they did this and it is called berna ulaid the gap of ulster to this day  now when they were setting out to cross the mountain    paragraph continues maeve gave orders that the army was to be divided in two parts each with its own share of cattle and of all other things and she said that she herself and fergus would go with the one part by the gap of ulster and that ailell should go with the other part by the road of midluachair  so ailell set out and his chariotdriver ferloga with him and that was the same ferloga that made a bargain with conchubar the high king one time and this is the way it happened it was at the time mac datho of leinster had stirred up a fight between the men of ulster and the men of connaught about the dividing of a pig at a feast he made the same way bricriu had stirred up a fight about the championship and conchubar was following after the men of connaught over the plain of fearbile and all of a sudden ferloga that had been left behind by ailell and that was hiding himself made a leap to the back of conchubars chariot and took hold of his neck between his two hands what will you give me to let you loose king he said what is it you are asking said conchubar indeed it is no great gift i am asking said ferloga but only you to bring me along with you to emain macha and the young women and the young girls of ulster to sing a song around me every evening and every one of them to say ferloga is my favourite conchubar agreed to that and ferloga went with him to emain but at the end of a year they sent him back and presents with him to ailell and to maeve  at that time a suspicion came on ailell that there was some understanding between maeve and fergus and he bade ferloga to keep a watch on them after a while ferloga saw that maeve and fergus had stopped in a wood behind the rest of the army and he followed after them quietly the way they would not hear him and there he found ferguss sword lying on the ground    so he took the sword out of the sheath and he cut a wooden sword and shaped it and put it into the sheath in its place and he brought ferguss sword back to ailell and told him how he had found it and aillel bade him hide it in his chariot when fergus saw that his sword was gone and a wooden sword was put in its place there was great confusion on him but ailell said nothing of it when they met but asked him to come and play a game of chess with him and at the game they quarrelled and ailell said sharp words of blame to fergus and to maeve and they answered him back and fergus bade him give him up his sword but ailell said he would never give it to him until the day of the great battle would come between the men of ireland and the men of ulster  then cuchulain came there and stood on a height and shook his spears and his sword before them so that great dread came on them  after that maeve sent fiacha son of firaba to talk with cuchulain and to try could he win him over what will you offer him said fiacha i will give him full payment for all that has been spoiled of his goods and a good place for himself in cruachan ai and my own protection and ailells if he will give up conchubars service and come into ours and indeed that would be better for him she said than to stop under a little king like conchubar  so fiacha went to speak with cuchulain and he gave him a good welcome and fiacha told him the message he had brought from maeve and the offer she had made if he would quit conchubars service i will not do that said cuchulain i will not betray my mothers brother for the sake of any strange king but i will consent to go myself tomorrow he said to speak with maeve and ailell and with fergus so fiacha bade him farewell and went back to the army    on the morning of the morrow cuchulain went to glen ochain and maeve and fergus came to meet him and maeve looked at him and she said: is this the same cuchulain you put such a great name on fergus i see that he has not yet grown out of his boyhood then she spoke with cuchulain and made her offer again and he refused it and they left the place with great anger on them one against the other and that night and the two nights after it the men of ireland were afraid either to eat or to sleep or to make music for cuchulain killed so many of their men before the clear light of every morning that it was as if the whole army was melting away some one must go and make him another offer said maeve and this time she sent mac roth the herald where will i find him said mac roth ask fergus for news of him said maeve it is likely said fergus he will be between ochain and the sea letting the sun shine and the wind blow upon him after so many nights spent without sleep  it was there he found him sure enough and laeg keeping a watch a good way off there is an armed man coming towards us cuchulain said laeg what sort of man is he said cuchulain a brownhaired broadfaced handsome young man a fine brown cloak on him a bright bronze spearlike brooch fastening his cloak a wellfitting shirt next his skin two strong shoes between his feet and the ground there is a white hazel rod in one hand and a sword with a seahorse tooth for a hilt in the other well laeg said cuchulain let him come for these are the tokens of a herald  mac roth came up to him then and asked: who are you serving under young man we are serving under conchubar high king of ulster can you tell me where can i find cuchulain that has killed so many of the men of ireland whatever you would say to him you may say it to me said cuchulain then mac roth told him all the new offers he had brought from    paragraph continues maeve and cuchulain said: i am cuchulain that you are looking for and i refuse all your offers so mac roth went back to the camp did you find cuchulain said maeve i found he said an angry boy between ochain and the sea and i do not know if it was cuchulain did he take your offer said maeve he did not said mac roth it is cuchulain he was talking to said fergus you must go to him again said maeve and make new offers so mac roth went out again to make some terms with cuchulain but he refused all his offers and another thing he said i would never consent to give in to a woman or to be under a womans rule is there any bargain you would make said mac roth if there is said cuchulain you must find it out for yourselves and there is one in the camp can tell you of it he said and if he himself comes to me i will speak with him but if any other man comes to me again with offers that will be the last day of his life  so mac roth went back again and told all this to maeve and i will not go near him again myself he said for all that any king in ireland could give me then maeve said to fergus: have you any knowledge of the terms cuchulain would take i have not said fergus but after she had questioned him a while he said: it is what he wants that one man of the men of ireland should meet him and fight alone with him every day and while that fight is going on he will put no hindrance on the rest of the army but it may march on but so soon as he has killed the man set i against him the army must stop and make its camp until the morning of the morrow i will agree to that said maeve for it is better to lose one man every day than a hundred every night and who will go and make this agreement with him fergus must go they all said i will not go    said fergus why so said ailell i will not go he said unless you bind yourselves on your oath to keep to your agreement with him we will do that they said and so fergus bound them on their oath and his horses were yoked to his chariot  then a young lad etarcomal by name of the people of maeve and of ailell made ready his own chariot what side are you going etarcomal said fergus i am going with you he said the way i will get a sight of cuchulain if you take my advice you will not make that journey said fergus why so because if your pride and his pride meet together some misfortune will surely happen i give my word not to anger him in any way said etarcomal  they went on then to where cuchulain was between ochain and the sea and himself and laeg were playing a game with their casting spears there is an armed man coming to us said laeg what sort of man is he said cuchulain he is large and proud and he standing in a high chariot and the waving yellow hair about his head gives him the appearance of the top of a tall tree that stands on a green lawn said laeg he has a crimson cloak about him with a deep border of gold thread and an inlaid gold brooch in the cloak a broad green spear in his hand a shield with a boss of red gold over him a long sword in a toothed sheath across his knees it is fergus that is in it said cuchulain then fergus came where he was and got out of his chariot and cuchulain gave him a great welcome do you welcome me indeed said fergus i do surely said cuchulain but if it is to look for a feast from me you are come     when a flock of birds passes over the plain a wild goose will fall to your share and when fish rise in the rivers a salmon will fall to your share a handful of seaweed and a handful of watercress we know well your hospitality is straitened in this war said fergus   the white birds are on the side of the cliffs and the fish are in the stream and the wild deer on the hills it is not to look for a feast i am come said fergus for i know well it is not easy for you to get your own share of food     paragraph continues but i am come for the men of ireland to agree to your conditions and from this out they will send one of their best men to fight with you alone every day i agree to keep to my part of the bargain said cuchulain and let us not stop talking here any more he said or the men of ireland will be thinking you are doing some treachery on them  so fergus went back to the camp but etarcomal stopped for a while looking at cuchulain what are you looking at said cuchulain i am looking at yourself he said then take your eyes off me and go after fergus and maybe you think yourself a better fighting man than the one you are looking at said cuchulain you look to me as good a fighter as i ever saw for one of your age said etarcomal but you would not be thought much of among trained fighters and grown men it is well for you said cuchulain it is under ferguss protection you came or i swear by the gods my people swear by you would not go back safe and sound to the camp you have no right to say that said etarcomal and what you want of the men of ireland i will give it to you he said for you ask for one champion at a time to fight with and i myself will be the first to come to you tomorrow come then said cuchulain and however early you may come in the morning you will find me here before you  so etarcomal set out and he began to tell his chariotdriver all he had said and how he had promised to go out and fight with cuchulain on the morrow did you make that promise said the driver i did said etarcomal and i have given my word i will goand i do not know he said would it be better for me to wait till tomorrow or to go back and fight with him today you will not get the better of him tomorrow said his driver and it would be just as well for you to be beaten tonight turn the chariot and let us go back said    paragraph continues etarcomal for i swear by the oath of my people i will not go back to the camp without bringing cuchulains head in my hand so they turned back again towards the sea  then laeg said: that chariot that was here a while ago has turned back again to us cuchulain it is etarcomal coming back to challenge me and it is not i that will fall in this fight said cuchulain but bring me my arms he said for it would not be right for me not to be ready to meet him so he went to meet him and took his sword out of the sheath and said: what are you come back for i am come to fight with you i am loth to fight with you said cuchulain for it was under the protection of fergus you came here  and with that he gave a blow of his sword that cut the sod clean away from under the soles of etarcomals feet so that he fell on his back go back now he said for you have had a warning i will not go back until i have fought with you then cuchulain gave another stroke with the edge of his sword that cut the hair close off his head but drew no blood you may go back now at least he said i will not go said etarcomal until i have made an end of you or you have made an end of me well said cuchulain if you are set upon that it is i must make an end of you with that he made a cross blow at him that cut him through and through so that he fell dead  fergus now had seen nothing of all this for it was his custom when he was travelling never to look back but always to be looking before him and presently etarcomals chariotdriver came up with him and he said: where have you left your master cuchulain is after attacking and making an end of him on the plain said the man it was not right of him to do that said fergus to any one that came under my protection turn my chariot about now he said    paragraph continues until i go back and talk with him and when he came to where cuchulain was he said: it was not right of you my own fosterson to kill one that came under my protection ask his chariotdriver said cuchulain on which of us the blame should be laid then the chariotdriver told the whole story and when fergus heard it he said: there is no blame on you cuchulain then he bound the body of etarcomal to his chariot so that it was dragged after it along the road and through the camp to the door of ailell and maeve there is the young man you sent out he said and this is the treatment cuchulain will give to every other man that goes out against him and maeve came out of the door and spoke high angry loud words: i had put great hopes in that young man she said and i did not think it was under bad protection he was going when he went under the protection of fergus and fergus said: what business had he going out at all to meddle with cuchulain and if i went there myself he said it is well pleased i was to get back again safely  the next day the men of ireland consulted together as to who should go against cuchulain and they agreed that it was best to send natchrantal that was a great fighting man  so he set out but he would bring no arms with him but three times nine holly rods and they having hardened points  cuchulain was at that time following after a flock of wild birds to bring some of them down for the evenings food and he took no notice of natchrantal but went on following after the birds but natchrantal thought it was afraid of him he was and he went back to the door of maeves tent and gave a loud shout and he said: that great cuchulain there is so much talk about is running away now after the challenge i gave him i would    hardly believe that said maeve for he has stood against many good fighting men before now and why would he not stand against you fergus heard what was said and it vexed him any man to say cuchulain had run before him and he sent fiacha son of firaba to reproach him for letting such a thing be said and cuchulain bade him welcome i am come from fergus said fiacha and it is what he says that it would have been more fitting for you to spill the blood of the man that was sent against you than to run from him who did i run from said cuchulain tell me who makes that boast it is natchrantal said fiacha what would fergus have me do said cuchulain would he have me kill an unarmed man for he brought nothing with him but wooden rods and it is not my custom to wound chariotdrivers or messengers or unarmed men but let him come out armed to meet me he said on the morning of tomorrow  so fiacha went back to the camp and the day seemed long to natchrantal till he could meet cuchulain but when he went out in the morning and came to the plain he said to cormac conloingeas: where is cuchulain he is there before you said he that is not the appearance that was on him yesterday said natchrantal for cuchulains anger had come on him so that the appearance he bad was changed and he was leaning against a pillarstone and in the strength of his anger as he was throwing his cloak about him he broke off the pillarstone and he never noticed that it was wrapped between the cloak and himself and natchrantal threw his sword at him and it broke to pieces against the pillarstone and then cuchulain gave him a blow over the top of his shield that struck off his head  while this fight was going on maeve having a third part of the army with her set out northward    to dunsobairce to look for the brown bull and cuchulain followed after her for a while but then he turned back to defend his own country and he saw before him buac son of bainblai that was the man maeve trusted better than any other and twentyfour men along with him and they driving the brown bull before them and fifteen of his heifers that they had brought out of glennamasc in slieve cuilinn where are you bringing these cattle from said cuchulain out of that mountain beyond what is your name he said if i tell it it is not either through love of you or through fear of you he said i am buac son of bainblai from ailells country and maeves take this from me then said cuchulain and with that he threw his spear at him so that it went through his body and he fell dead but while he was doing this the rest of the men drove away the bull with great haste to the camp of the men of ireland and this was the greatest affront that was put on cuchulain through the whole of the war for the brown bull of cuailgne  then the men of ireland began saying to one another that cuchulain would not have the mastery over them but for the bronze spear he had and that there must be enchantment on it for none of them could stand against it and they said to maeve that she should send rae the satirist to ask it of him for he could not refuse a satirist so rae went and asked it of him give me your spear be said i will not give you that indeed said cuchulain but i will give you other things i will not take any other thing said rae and i will put a bad name on you if you refuse me the spear take it then said cuchulain and with that he threw it with all his force at his head that is a weighty present said the satirist and he dropped dead  then cur son of daltach was sent out for the men of ireland thought he would be able to rid them of    cuchulain but it was hard to persuade cur because he thought it was not worth his while to go and fight with a young beardless boy and when he went out in the morning cuchulain was practising all his feats that he had learned and cur was for a while trying to get near enough to come at him with his weapons but he could not and cuchulain was so taken up with doing his feats that he never noticed him at all then laeg saw him and said: have a care cuchulain there is an armed man making ready to attack you cuchulain was doing his apple feat at that time keeping nine apples and his shield and his sword in the air that none of them fell to the ground and when he saw cur he threw the apple that was in his hand straight at his forehead and it went through and brought out a share of his brains the size of itself at the other side  and after that other fighting men were sent out every day through a week and he killed them all and one day he said: go laeg to the camp to my friends lugaid and ferbaeth and ferdiad and say you are come from me and ask them which of the men of ireland is to be sent against me tomorrow so laeg went and when he came back he said: it is your own comrade and fellowpupil with scathach ferbaeth your bloodfriend is coming against you for he has only lately joined the army and he has brought fourfifths of his men with him and maeve has promised him her daughter findabair and he has drunk from her cup and been fed by her hand and it is not to every one maeve gives the ale that she gave out for ferbaeth i am sorry to hear that said cuchulain for i think worse of a comrade of my own coming against me than of any other man and when ferbaeth came out to fight against him in the morning cuchulain did his best to make him give up the fight for the sake of their old friendship but ferbaeth would not listen cuchulain turned from him then in anger and to loosen the bloodbond between them he struck the    sole of his own foot with a spear that it drew blood and then he threw his spear at ferbaeth but he did not look to see did it hit him or not but the spear went through his head and out of his mouth and this is the way ferbaeth came to his death  then ailell made up a plan by which he thought to make cuchulain give up the stand he was making against the army and his plan was to offer findabair to him if he would give his word to leave off attacking the men of ireland and he sent lugaid to make the offer to him cuchulain was not very well pleased with the message and he thought there might be some treachery in it but he agreed that he would meet ailell and findabair and speak with them but when the time came ailell made his fool put on his clothes and wear his gold circle on his head and go with findabair and he bade him stop as far back as he could the way cuchulain would not know it was not the king that was in it and then findabair was to bind him over to their side not to fight any more against the men of ireland and when that was done she herself and the fool were to hurry back to the camp together but when cuchulain saw them he knew the fool and he sent a stone out of his sling and killed him and because findabair had taken a share in the treachery he cut off her two plaits of hair and took them away and after a while ailell and maeve came to see what had happened them and there they found findabair beside the dead body of the fool and they brought her home and said nothing of it but all the same the story was talked of in the camp  then cuchulain sent laeg into the camp again to ask news of lugaid and it is what lugaid told him that the next to be sent against him was his own brother larine that maeve had persuaded with wine and with the promise of findabair to go against him and it is what they think said lugaid that if cuchulain    should kill my brother i myself would have to go and get satisfaction for his death and tell cuchulain he said not to make an end of larine but only to give him some punishment he will not forget so when larine came out at the breaking of the day cuchulain struck the weapons out of his hands as one might strike toys out of the hands of a child and he took him in his two hands and shook him and left him there with the life still in him but he was never the better of the shaking he got to the end of his life  as cuchulain lay in his sleep one night a great cry from the north came to him so that he started up and fell from his bed to the ground like a sack he went out of his tent and there he saw laeg yoking the horses to the chariot why are you doing that he said because of a great cry i heard from the plain to the northwest said laeg let us go there then said cuchulain so they went on till they met with a chariot and a red horse yoked to it and a woman sitting in it with red eyebrows and a red dress on her and a long red cloak that fell on to the ground between the two wheels of the chariot and on her back she had a grey spear what is your name and what is it you are wanting said cuchulain i am the daughter of king buan she said and what i am come for is to find you and to offer you my love for i have heard of all the great deeds you have done it is a bad time you have chosen for coming said cuchulain for i am wasted and worn out with the hardship of the war and i have no mind to be speaking with women you will have my help in everything you do she said and it is protecting you i was up to this and i will protect you from this out it is not trusting to a womans protection i am in this work i have in my hands said cuchulain then if you will not take my help she said i will turn it against you and at the time when you will be fighting with some man as good as yourself i will    come against you in all shapes by water and by land till you are beaten there was anger on cuchulain then and he took his sword and made a leap at the chariot but on the moment the chariot and the horse and the woman had disappeared and all he saw was a black crow and it sitting on a branch and by that he knew it was the morrigu had been talking with him  after that loch son of mofebis was sent for to maeve and she asked him would he go out to the next days fight i will not go he said for it would not be fitting for me to go out against a young boy whose beard is not grown but i have one to meet him he said and that is my brother long son of emonis and you can make an agreement with him so then long was sent for and maeve promised him a great reward suits of armour for twelve men and a chariot and findabair for a wife and the right of coming to every feast at cruachan then long went out to the fight but cuchulain killed him  then maeve said to her women: go now to cuchulain and tell him to put some likeness of a beard on himself and say to him there is no good warrior in the camp thinks it fitting to go out and fight him he being young and beardless  when cuchulain heard what maeve had said he smeared his face the way he would have the appearance of a beard and then he came out on the hill and showed himself to the men of ireland when loch son of mofebis saw him he said: is that a beard on cuchulain that is certainly what i see said maeve then i will go out and meet him said loch so they met beside the ford where long had got his death come to the ford that is higher up said loch for he would not fight at the ford where his brother died so they fought at the upper ford and while they were fighting the morrigu came against    paragraph continues cuchulain with the appearance of a white redeared heifer and fifty other heifers along with her and a chain of white bronze between every two of them and they made a rush into the ford but cuchulain made a cast at her and wounded one of her eyes then she came down the stream in the shape of a black eel and wound herself about cuchulains legs in the water and while he was getting himself free of her and bruising her against a green stone of the ford loch wounded his body then she took the appearance of a grey wolf and took hold of his right arm and while he was getting free of her loch wounded him again then great anger came on him and he took the spear aoife had given him the gae bulg and gave him a deadly wound i ask one thing for the sake of your great name cuchulain he called out what thing is that it is not to spare my life i am asking you said loch but let me rise up the way i may fall on my face and not backwards towards the men of ireland so that none of them can say it was in running away or in going backward i fell i will surely give that leave said cuchulain for the thing you ask is a right gift for a fighting man and after that he went back to his own campingplace  now on that day above any other a very downhearted feeling came on cuchulain he to be fighting alone against the four provinces of ireland and he bade laeg to go to conchubar and to the men of ulster and to say to them that he the son of dechtire was tired with fighting every day and with the wounds he had got and not one of his people or his friends coming to help him  after that maeve sent out six all together against him three men and three women that understood enchantments but he destroyed than all and now that maeve had broken her agreement with him not to send more than one against him at a time he did not spare    her men any longer but from where he was he used his sling so well that in the whole army there was neither dog horse or man that dared turn his face towards cuchulain  it was one day at that time the morrigu came to try and get healing of her wounds from him for it was only by his own hand the wounds he gave could be healed she took the appearance of an old woman on her and she milking a cow with three teats cuchulain was passing by and there was thirst on him and he asked a drink and she gave him the milk of one teat may this be to the good of the giver he said and with that her eye that was wounded was healed then she gave him milk from another teat and he said the same words then she gave him the milk from the third teat the full blessing of the gods and of the people of the plough on you he said and with that all the wounds of the great queen were healed  then the men of the four great provinces of ireland made their camp and put up walls at the place called the great breach on the plain of muirthemne but they sent the cattle they had with them southward and cuchulain took his place on a mound and in the evening laeg made a fire for him there and the flame flashed on the bright shining weapons of the man of ireland and when cuchulain saw so many of them and they so near him great anger came on him and he took his spears and his shield and his sword and shook them and he gave out his loud hero cry and it was such a treat cry he gave that the bocanachs and bananachs and the witches of the valley answered it from all parts  and when the men in the camp heard these great cries they thought it was an attack that was being made upon them and they ran against one another and fought one another in their fright so that a hundred of them were killed in that night    then laeg saw a man coming through the camp from the northeast there is a man coming towards us little hound he said what is the appearance on him said cuchulain he is very tall and handsome and shining and he has a green cloak about him fastened with a silver brooch a shirt of silk that is embroidered with red gold falling to his knees a black shield in his hand with a border of white bronze and a spear with five prongs and it is a strange thing he said that no one in the whole camp seems to see him or to take any heed of him that is so said cuchulain and the men of ireland take no heed of him because they cannot see him and i know well it is one of my friends among the sidhe that is coming to give me help and relief for they know it is hard for me to be standing alone against the four provinces of ireland  then the man of the sidhe that was lugh of the long hand came and spoke with cuchulain and it is what he said that he knew he was tired out and in want of sleep and sleep now cuchulain he said by the grave in the lerga and i myself will keep watch over you till the end of three days and three nights so cuchulain fell asleep there and then by the grave that is in the lerga and no wonder in that for he had been fighting since before the feast of samhain without sleep but all the while killing and attacking and destroying the men of irelandunless he might sleep a little while beside his spear in the middle of the day his head on his hand and his hand on his spear and his spear on his knee and while he was lying in his heavy sleep the man of the sidhe put druid herbs on his wounds so that they were all healed so he slept for three days and three nights and at the end of that time he rose up and passed his hand over his face and he blushed red from head to foot with the strengthening of his courage that he felt in him and he would have been ready to go there and then    into any great gathering or feasting hall in all ireland how long have i been in my sleep he asked the man three days and three nights then you have done me a bad turn indeed he said for the men of ireland have been left in quiet all that time they were not indeed said the man who was it stood up to them then said cuchulain it was the boy troop came from the north from emain macha he said three times fifty sons of the chief men of ulster and they attacked the army three times and they killed three times their own number but they themselves were all killed in the end and follaman son of conchubar was leading them and he had made a boast that he would never go home again unless he could bring ailells head along with him and the gold crown that was on it but two fostersons of ailell the two sons of betchach son of baen fell on him and wounded him so that he got his death my grief and oh my grief that i was not there said cuchulain for if i had been in it the boy troop would never have been destroyed and conchubars son would not have come to his death do not be fretting little hound said the strange man there is no reproach on your name by it stop here with me tonight said cuchulain and the two of us together will avenge the boy troop i will not indeed said he but let you yourself play the game out now with the men of ireland for it is not they that have power over your life at this time  with that he went away and cuchulain said to laeg yoke the scythed chariot for me now if you have the things belonging to it then laeg rose up and got ready the chariot and he put on his light dress of deerskins that was spotted and striped and closefitting so that his arms were left free and over that he put his ravenblack cloak and his shining helmet on his head and on his forehead he put the narrow band of gold that    chariotdrivers were used to wear and then he threw over the horses the cloths that covered them all over and that were studded with little blades and spikes and points so that every time the chariot moved it brought some sharp point against those that were near it the way every point and every head of the chariot would cut its sure path and he gathered the reins in his hand and the goad and the long whip  and then cuchulain put on his armour and took his spears and his sword and his shield that had a rim so sharp it would cut a hair against the stream and his cloak that was made of the precious fleeces of the land of the sidhe that had been brought to him by manannan from the king of sorcha he went out then against the men of ireland and attacked them and his anger came on him so that it was not his own appearance he had on him but the appearance of a god and after that he turned back and left them and there was no wound on himself or on the horses or on laeg that day and he made a round of the whole army mowing men down on every side in revenge for the boy troop of emain  but the next day he was standing on the hill young and comely and shining and the cloud of his anger had gone from him then the women and the young girls in the camp and the poets and the singers came out to look at him but maeve hid her face behind a shelter of shields thinking he might make a cast at her with his sling and there was wonder on these women to see him so quiet and so gentle today and he such a terror to the whole army yesterday and they bade the men lift them up on their shields to the height of their shoulders the way they could have a good sight of him  but dubthach the beetle of ulster saw his own wife climbing up with the other women to look at cuchulain and great anger and jealousy came on him and he said to the chief men of the army that it would be best for    them to surround cuchulain secretly on all sides and then to let on to be fighting among themselves so as to lead him down where he could not escape them but when fergus was told this he gave a great kick of his foot to dubthach that sent him from where he was and he spoke angry words against dubthach and he told him he would be well paid for the harm he had planned whenever the men of ulster would get up from their weakness and come out to help cuchulain  and that night the army of ireland made their camp at the great stone in the country of ross and then maeve asked which of them would go out and fight with cuchulain on the morrow but every one of the men of ireland said: it is not i that will go it is not one of my family that should be sent to his death then maeve asked fergus to go out and fight him it is not right for you said fergus to ask me to go against a young boy and he my own pupil and my fosterson but maeve pressed him so hard that he could not but take the work in hand and early in the morning he went out to the ford of fighting where cuchulain was when cuchulain saw him coming he said: truly my master it is not safe for you to come and fight and you without a sword for ailell had not given him back his own sword yet it is no matter he said for if i had a sword in my sheath it is not on you i would use it and now cuchulain he said for the sake of all i did for you and all conchubar and the whole of ulster did for you in your bringingup let you give way before me today in the sight of the men of ireland indeed i am loth to give way before any man in this war said cuchulain you need not mind that said fergus for i will do the same for you when the great last battle of this war is fought it is then i will turn and run before you when you are covered with wounds and with blood and if i run then he said all the men of    paragraph continues ireland will run along with me so cuchulain agreed to do that because it would be for the profit of ulster and he bade laeg make ready his chariot and presently as if he had been beaten by fergus he gave way to him in the sight of the men of ireland when they saw it they called out: he is running before you fergus and maeve called out: follow him fergusmake haste the way he will not escape you i will not indeed said fergus i will follow him no farther and if you think i did not make him run far enough he said i did more than all the rest of the men that went against him up to this and i will make no other attack on him he said until all the men of ireland have fought with him one by one  so that was the end of the fight between fergus and cuchulain  there was a man of connaught at that time whose name was ferchu and he had been at war with ailell and maeve from the time they got the kingdom and he used to be robbing the country and destroying it so that he was made an outlaw and some of his men heard that the whole army of connaught was being vexed and hindered by one man and when they told it to ferchu he said: it would be a good chance for us to go and attack that man and to bring his head with us to ailell and maeve for if we do that he said they will forgive us all the harm we have done their country  so he himself and his twelve men went forward to where cuchulain was and they attacked him all together but cuchulain was not long in making an end of them and he struck off their heads and put them on twelve stones and he put ferchus head on a stone by itself  then the men of ireland consulted together again who they would send out to fight on the next day and    it is what they all said that it was calatin and his twentyseven sons and his sisters son glas son of delga should go out now it is the way they were every man of them had poison in himself and in his weapons and there was not one of them ever made a cast of a spear or a stone that missed and there was no one that would be wounded by them but be would die either on the spot or within nine days so great rewards were promised them if they would go out against cuchulain and fergus was there at the time the business was knotted and surely every one said they are only one man for they are all members of calatins body after that fergus went into his tent to his people and he gave a deep groan of trouble and he said: my grief for the thing that is to be done tomorrow what thing is that said they all cuchulain to be killed he said who would kill him said they calatin and his sons he said and if there is any one of you would go and watch the fight and bring me word what happens i would give him a good reward and my blessing i will go said fiacha son of firaba  so in the morning calatin with his sons and his sisters son rose up and went to where cuchulain was and fiacha son of firaba went along with them and as soon as they came near him they threw their twentynine spears at him all together in one cast and not one of them drew blood for he caught them all on his shield then cuchulain drew his sword from the sheath to hack off the spears and to lighten his shield but while he was doing that they all ran at him as one man and put their twentynine right hands on his head and forced his face down to the gravel and the sand of the ford and he gave out his great hero cry and the cry of a man in unequal fight and there was not a man in the camp and he not dead or asleep but heard it    then fiacha son of firaba came up and when he saw what had happened the love of his own countryman came over him and he pulled out his sword and hit the nineandtwenty hands off calatin and his sons with one blow cuchulain raised up his head then and gave a deep sigh of relief and he saw who it was had come to his help that was done quiet and easy my good comrade he said you may think it is quiet and easy i was said fiacha but if what i did is heard of in the camp the reward that will fall on me will not be quiet and easy for if the men of the children of rudraige should hear of the stroke i made for you it is with sword and spear my reward will be paid i give you my word said cuchulain that now i have lifted my head and got my breath again unless you tell tales on yourself none of these men will tell tales on you  with that he made an attack on calatin and his sons and he began to hack and to cut at them till there was nothing left of them but limbs and little pieces eastward and westward over the whole face of the ford only one man of them glas son of delga got away and ran but cuchulain rushed after him and gave him a great blow but he got as far as ailell and maeves tent and all he could say was fiacha fiacha before he fell dead  fergus and maeve said: what debts are those he called out aboutfor fiacha is the word for a debt in irish i do not know indeed said fergus unless it might be that some one in the camp owed him a debt and that it was on his mind that must have been so said ailell by my word said fergus however it was all his debts are paid now  and at the ford where calatin and his sons got their death there is a stone with the marks of their swordhilts and the buttends of their spears on it to this day  then it was settled by the men of ireland that it was    paragraph continues ferdiad son of daire the great champion of the men of domnand should go out and meet cuchulain the next day for they had the same way of fighting and it was with the same teachers they had learned the knowledge of arms with scathach and with uathach and with aoife and neither of them had an advantage over the other except that cuchulain had the feat of the gae bulg but ferdiad had good armour to protect him against any man he would fight with  so they sent messengers to bring ferdiad but he refused and would not come for he knew it was what they wanted of him to fight against his friend his companion and his fellow pupil cuchulain  then maeve sent the druids and the satirists to him that they might make three hurtful satires and three hilltop satires on him if he would not come with them that would raise three blisters on his face shame and blemish and reproach so that if he did not die on the moment he would be dead before the end of nine days  then ferdiad came with them for the sake of his good name for he thought it better to fall by spears than by satires and when he came he was received with honour and attendance and he was served with pleasant drinks so that he grew merry and his mind was confused and great rewards were offered him if he would go out against cuchulain clothes of all colours for his men and speckled satins and silver and gold and the equal of his own lands of the level plains of magh ai without rent or disturbance secure to his son and to his grandson and to their children to the end of life and time  and it is what maeve said: it is a great reward i am giving you ferdiad and why would you not accept it and ferdiad was making excuses i will not take your reward without good pledges he said for it is a heavy fight is before me he that has the name of    cuchulain is surely a good hound i will give you a champions pledge said maeve you will not be bound to come to our gatherings you will get horses and bridles i will call you my friend above all other men i will not go to this fight said ferdiad without some other securities for this is a fight will be heard of till the end of life and time take all you want said maeve there is no delay except with yourself bind us till you are satisfied by the right hand of kings and of princes there is nothing i will refuse you i must have six securities and no less said ferdiad before i will go out and be destroyed by cuchulain and all the whole army looking on i will give you whatever securities you want said maeve however hard it may be to come at them domnall in his chariot niaman of the slaughter both of them protectors of bards bind morann if you want sure payment bind carpre min of manand he that has a string of knowledge in his harp bind our own two sons o maeve it is a bitter woman you are said ferdiad and it is not a gentle wife to a husband you are but it is a fit queen you are for cruachan of the swords with your high talk and your fierce strength but in spite of all the words you are stirring me up with he said if you would offer me the land and the sea i would not take them without the sun and the moon along with them you need not wait longer than today and tomorrow said maeve before you will get your fill of all sorts of the jewels of the earth and here is my brooch with its hooked pin she said and more than all that ferdiad so soon as you have killed this hound of feats i will give you findabair of the champions queen of the west of elga     then every one was saying what great rewards those were but however great they are said ferdiad it is with maeve herself they will stay and not with myself and i will not take them to go into battle with my fellow and my dear friend that is cuchulain and it is what he said:  a pity indeed a woman to have come between myself and himself the half of my heart is cuchulains without fault and i am the half of his own heart  by my shield if cuchulain were killed from ath cliath it is i would thrust my sword through my heart through my side through my breast  by my sword if cuchulain were killed from glen bolg i would kill no man after him till i had leaped over the edge of the well  by my hand if the hound were killed from glen an scail i would make an end of maeve and her army and of no one else of the men of ireland  by my spear if it were from ath cro the hound was killed it is i would be buried in his grave the one grave would be for the two of us  say to him the hound without blemish that scathach without fear made a prophecy i would be put down by him at a ford  misfortune on maeve misfortune on maeve that put her face between us sending us one against the other myself and strong cuchulain  then maeve said to her people the way she would stir him up: it is a true word cuchulain spoke what word was that said ferdiad he said it would be no great wonder if you would fall by him in the first trial of arms in this country he had no right to say that said ferdiad for it is not fear or want of skill he learned of me up to this time and i swear by my arms if it is true he said this thing that i will be the first to fight with him tomorrow before the men of ireland may good be with you for saying that said maeve and this is better to me than to see you show fear or weakness for every man cares for his own country and why has he a right to do more for the profit of ulster than you would do for the profit of connaught      ferdiad gave in to her then and he bound her on the sureties of the aforesaid six for the fulfillment of her    promises of the reward and she bound him to fight with cuchulain on the morrow  then fergus got his horses harnessed and his chariot yoked and he went out to where cuchulain was to tell him of all that had happened my welcome before you my master fergus said cuchulain i am glad of that welcome my pupil said fergus but what i am come for is to tell you who it is that is coming to fight at the early hour of the morning of tomorrow i will listen to that said cuchulain your own friend and companion and fellowpupil the man that learned the use of arms with you ferdiad son of daire the hero of the men of domnand i give my word said cuchulain it is not my wish my friend to come out against me and now said fergus you must be careful and ready more than any other time for there was not the like of ferdiad among any of the men who have fought you up to this i am here said cuchulain hindering and delaying the four great provinces of ireland from the beginning of the winter to the beginning of spring and i have not drawn back one foot before any man in that time and i think it likely i will not draw back before him neither has ferdiad any fear on him before you now his anger is stirred up said fergus and besides that he has good armour to protect him be quiet now fergus and do not let me hear any more of that story said cuchulain i was always well able to stand against him in any place or on any ground it is not easy to get the better of him said fergus for he is fierce in fighting and he has the strength of a hundred there will be a sharp fight when myself and ferdiad come to the ford said cuchulain it will not be without being told in stories o cuchulain of the red sword said fergus it would be better to me than a great reward you to carry proud ferdiads purple cloak eastward    paragraph continues i give my word and my oath said cuchulain it is i myself will get the victory over ferdiad then fergus went back to the encampment  at the same time ferdiad went to his tent and to his people and told them how he was bound by maeve to fight with cuchulain on the morrow and he told how he had bound maeve by six sureties for the fulfilment of her promises if cuchulain should fall by him  it is not happy in their minds the people of ferdiads tent were that night but gloomy and heavyhearted for they were sure that wherever cuchulain and ferdiad would meet it was there one of them would get his death and they were sure that one would be their own master for no one at all had been able to stand against cuchulain since the beginning of the war  ferdiad slept through the early part of the night very heavily and when the latter end of the night came his sleep went from him and his drunkenness had passed away and the thought of the fight was pressing on him and he bade his driver to harness the horses and to yoke his chariot but the driver tried to turn him from it it would be better for you to stop here than to go he said for my liking of it is not more than my disliking  be silent boy said ferdiad for i will not be turned from this journey by any young lad but i will go to the ford a ford the ravens will be croaking over i will fight with cuchulain till i wound his strong body till i crush the courage out of him the way that he will die  it would be better for you to stop here said the driver for it is not gentle your threats are your parting will be sorrowful there is one to whom it will be a sickness grief will come of that meeting with cuchulain it is long it will be remembered it is a pity for him who goes that journey it is not right what you are saying said ferdiad it is not for a brave man to    refuseit is not in our race i will delay no longer courage is better than fear let us set out now to the ford  then ferdiads horses were harnessed and his chariot was yoked and he went forward to the ford and the day with its full light came upon him there now boy he said spread out the skins and the cushions of my chariot under me here until i get some sleep and rest for i got no sleep at the end of the night with the care of the fight upon me  so his servant unharnessed the horses and settled the skins and cushions of the chariot under him and the heavy rest of sleep came upon him  but as to cuchulain he did not rise up at all till the day had come with its full light the way the men of ireland would not say it was fear that was on him that made him rise and when the day came: it would be as well laeg he said to yoke the chariot for it is an earlyrising man that is coming to meet us today  the horses are harnessed and the chariot is yoked said laeg let you get into it and there will be no hindrance to your courage  with that the readyhanded battlewinning son of sualtim leaped into the chariot and there shouted around him the bocanachs and bananachs and witches of the valley for the tuatha de danaan were used to set up their shouts around him the way the fear and the wonder would be great before him in every fight he would go into  and it was not long until ferdiads driver heard the noise coming near the straining of the harness the creaking of the chariot the ringing of the armour and of the shield the trampling of the horses the joyful coming of cuchulain to the ford  the driver came and laid his hand on his master good ferdiad he said rise up here they are coming    for i hear he said the creaking of a chariot it has come over breg ross over braine it has come over the highway by the foot of baileinbile he is a mighty hound that urges it he is a good driver that yokes it he is a free hawk that hurries his horses towards the south it is not he that will be slow in the fight it is a pity for him that is on the height waiting for the hound of valour it is a year ago i foretold there would come a hound the hound of emain a hound with all colours about himthe hound of ulster the hound of battle i hear himi have heard him coming  good servant said ferdiad why is it you have been praising that man ever since you came out from the house it is likely you are not without wages for your great praise of him yet it has been foretold to me by ailell and by maeve it is he that will fall by me and it is a time to help me he said and let you be silent and give up praising him that your foretelling may not come true it is not for you to give up on the brink of the fight surely i will soon have the reward  and the driver said: he is coming not slowly but quick as the wind or as water from a high cliff or like swift thunder surely you have taken wages for these great praises you put upon him said ferdiad it is not against him you are but praising him and putting a great name on him  it was not long then until ferdiad saw cuchulain coming to towards him in his chariot and it is how his two horses were going a hawk sweeping from a cliff on a day of hard wind or like a sweeping gust of the spring wind on a march day over a smooth plain or like the swiftness of a wild stag when he is first started by the hounds in his first field as if they were on fiery flagstones so that the earth was shaking and trembling with the quickness of their going  so cuchulain reached the ford and ferdiad came to    the south side and cuchulain drew up on the north side and ferdiad bade cuchulain welcome i am happy at your coming cuchulain he said i would have been glad of that welcome up to this time said cuchulain but today i do not take it as the welcome of a friend and ferdiad he said it would be fitter for me to welcome you than for you to welcome me for it is you have come to me in the country and province where i am and it is not right for you to come to fight with me but it is i should go to fight with you for it is out before you are the women and the children the young men and the horses the flocks the herds and the cattle of the province of ulster  good cuchulain said ferdiad what has brought you to fight with me at all for when we were with scathach and with uathach and with aoife you were my servingboy to tie up my spears and to make ready my bed that is true indeed said cuchulain but it was as less in age than you i was used to do so but that is not the story that will be told of us after this day for there is not a man in the whole world i would not fight today  and it is then each of them spoke sharp unfriendly words against the other and it is what ferdiad said: what has brought you o hound to fight with a strong fighter it is red your blood will be flowing over the harness of your horses it is a pity for your journey it is long it will be spoken of you will be in much want of healing if you ever get back to your own house he said  i have fought with heroes with chiefs of armies with troops with hundreds before now said cuchulain and what i have to do today is to make an end of you to bring you down in our first path of battle  you have met now with a man that will put reproach on you said ferdiad for it is i myself will do that it is well the loss of the men of ulster will be    remembered he said their champion to be put down and they looking on  what way shall we meet one another said cuchulain is it in our chariots we had best fight or is it with my sword and spear i am to overthrow you if the time has come and ferdiad said: before the setting of the sun tonight you will be fighting as if with a mountain and it is not white that battle will be the men of ulster will be shouting for you he said till you grow overbold but it is sorrowful they will be when your ghost passes over them and through them you are fallen into the gap of danger ferdiad said cuchulain the end of your life has come not by treachery but by sharp weapons you may think much of yourself till we meet one another but you will never fight in a battle again from this day to the end of time leave off now from your boastings said ferdiad it is you are the greatest boaster in the world i know well you are no fighter at all you heart of a bird in a cage you are but a giggling fellow without courage without strength but cuchulain said: when we were together with scathach we used to be practising together we used to go to every battle together because of our bravery that was equal you were my heart companion you were my people you were my familyi never found one was dearer it is sorrowful your death would be to me  where is the use of all this talk said ferdiad your great name will be lost your head will be on a stake before the crowing of the cock madness and grief are taking hold of you cuchulain be said and it is bad treatment you will get from me because it is on yourself the fault is  good ferdiad cuchulain said then it was not right for you to come out against me through the stirring up and the meddling of ailell and of maeve and none of those who came before you got victory or success but    they all fell by me and you will fall along with them and o ferdiad strong fighter he said do not come against me the meeting will bring sorrow to many and what is worse than sorrow to you have you not been bought with many presents a purple belt a suit of armour but ferdiad he said the woman for whom you are come to this fight findabair daughter of maeve however comely she may be will never be given to you for she has been offered to many before you he said and many like you have been wounded for her sake and he said and ferdiad began to listen to him:  do not break your oath not to fight me do not break friendship do not break the word you gave me do not come against me  the woman has been promised to fifty others it was a heavy gift for them it is by me they were sent to their grave it was by me they got the end that was fitting for them  though ferbaeth was boastful he who had a houseful of brave men it is short the time was till i quieted his rage i killed him by the one cast  the striking down of srub daires courage was bitter to him it is he held the secrets of a hundred women he had a great name at one time it is not silver thread but gold thread was in his clothes  if it were to me the woman was promised on whom the kings of the fair province smile i would not bring the red blood on your body for it south or north east or west  and good ferdiad he said this is why it is not right for you to come to this fight when we were with scathach it is together we used to go to every battle to every wild place through every darkness and every hardship we were heart companions we were comrades in gatherings we shared the one bed where we used to sleep sound sleep we used to practise together    in many far countries we used to go to hard fights we used to go through every forest together  o cuchulain of the wonderful feats said ferdiad although we learned knowledge together and although i know the bonds friendship put upon us it is i that will give you your first wounds not be remembering our companionship for it will not protect you and it is too long we are delaying like this he said and what arms shall we use today cuchulain  it is you have the choice of arms today said cuchulain for it is you were the first to reach the ford do you remember at all said ferdiad the casting spears we used to practise with scathach and with uacthach and with aoife i remember them indeed said cuchulain if you remember let us begin with them said ferdiad  so they began with their casting weapons and they took their protecting shields and their roundhandled spears and their little quill spears and their ivoryhiked knives and their ivoryhafted spears eight of each of them they had and these were flying from them and to them like bees on the wing on a fine summer day there was no cast that did not hit and each one went on shooting at the other with those weapons from the twilight of the early morning to the full midday until all their weapons were blunted against the faces and the bosses of the shields and as good as the throwing was the defence was so good that neither of them drew blood from the other through that time  let us leave these weapons now cuchulain said ferdiad for it is not by the like of them our fight will be settled let us leave them indeed if the time is come said cuchulain  they stopped then and threw their darts into the hands of their chariotdrivers what weapons shall we use now cuchulain said ferdiad the choice of    weapons is yours till night said cuchulain let us then said ferdiad take to our straight spears with the flaxen strings in them let us now indeed said cuchulain and then they took two stout shields and they took to their spears  each of them went on throwing at the other with the spears from the middle of midday until the fall of evening and good as the defence was yet the throwing was so good that each of them wounded the other in that time  let us leave this now said ferdiad let us leave it indeed if the time has come said cuchulain  so they left off and they threw their spears away from them into the hands of their chariotdrivers each of them came to the other then and each put his hands round the neck of the other and gave him three kisses their horses were in the one enclosure that night and their chariotdrivers at the one fire and their chariotdrivers spread beds of green rushes for them with wounded mens pillows on them the men that had knowledge of healing came then and put herbs of healing to their wounds and of every herb and plant that was put to cuchulains wounds he would send an equal share from him westward over the ford to ferdiad the way the men of ireland might not say if ferdiad should fall by him that it was by better means of cure he was able to overcome him  and of every kind of food and of drink that was sent by the men of ireland to ferdiad he would send a fair share over the ford northward to cuchulain because the providers of ferdiad were more than the providers of cuchulain all the men of ireland were providers to ferdiad for beating off cuchulain from them but only the bregians were providers to cuchulain they used to come and to be talking with him at the dusk of every night    they rested there that night and they rose up early on the morrow and came forward to the ford of battle  what weapons shall we use today ferdiad said cuchulain  it is you have the choice of weapons until night said ferdiad because i had my choice of them the last day let us then said cuchulain take to our great broad spears today for we shall be nearer to the end of our battle by the thrusting today than we were by the throwing yesterday  each of them continued to cut and to wound and to redden the other from the twilight of the early morning till the fall of the evening if it were the custom for birds in their flight to pass through the bodies of men they could have passed through their bodies on that day and they could have carried pieces of flesh and blood through their stabs and cuts into the clouds and the sky all around and when the fall of evening came their horses were tired and their chariotdrivers were downhearted and they were tired themselves as well  let us stop from this now ferdiad said cuchulain for our horses are tired and our chariotdrivers are downhearted and when they are tired why would not we be tired as well and we are not bound to go on for ever he said as is the custom with the fomor let us put the quarrel away for a while now the noise of the fighting is over let us leave off indeed if the time is come said ferdiad  they threw their spears from them then into the hands of their chariotdrivers and each of them came towards the other each of them put his hand round the neck of the other and gave him three kisses their horses were in the one enclosure that night and their chariotdrivers at the one fire  their chariotdrivers made beds of green rushes for them with wounded mens pillows on them and the men that had knowledge of healing came to examine them    that night but they could do nothing more for them because of the deepness of their many wounds but to use charms and spells on them to staunch their blood every charm and every spell that was used on the wounds of cuchulain he sent a full share of them over the ford westward to ferdiad and of every sort of food and of drink that was sent to ferdiad he sent a share of them over the ford northward to cuchulain  they rested there that night and they rose up early on the morrow and they came forward to the ford of battle cuchulain saw a sort of a dark look on ferdiad that day it is bad you are looking today ferdiad he said there is a darkness on your face and a heaviness on your eyes and your own appearance is gone from you it is not from fear or dread of you i am like this today said ferdiad for there is not a champion in ireland today i could not put down and cuchulain was fretted to see him that way and it is what he said: o ferdiad if it is you yourself i am sure you are a miserable man to have come at the bidding of a woman to fight against your own companion but ferdiad said: o cuchulain giver of wounds true hero every man must come in the end to the sod where his last grave shall be  as to findabair daughter of maeve said cuchulain whatever her beauty may be it is not for love of you she was given to you but only for the sake of your great strength o hound of the gentle sway said ferdiad it is long ago my strength was tried but i never heard of any man braver in fight than yourself i never met so brave a man until today it is your own fault what has happened said cuchulain you to have come at the bidding of a woman to try your sword against your fellow if i had gone back said ferdiad without doing battle with you it is little my name and my    word would be thought of by ailell and by maeve of cruachan no one has ever put food to his lips said cuchulain and no one has ever been born in honour of a king or queen for whose sake i would have harmed you o cuchulain winner of battles said ferdiad it was not you but maeve that betrayed me let you take the victory and the fame for it is not on you the blame is  and cuchulain said: my faithful heart is like a clot of blood my life is nearly gone from me i have no strength for high deeds fighting with you ferdiad much as you are complaining over me now said ferdiad what arms shall we use today it is you have the choice today said cuchulain because it was i had it yesterday let us then said ferdiad take to our swords today for we will be nearer the end of our battle by the hewing today than we were by the thrusting yesterday let us do so indeed said cuchulain  and then they put two long wide shields on them and they took to their swords and each of them continued to hack at the other from the dawn of the early morning till the time of the fall of evening let us leave off from this now said cuchulain so they left off  they threw their swords from them into the hands of their chariotdrivers and it was the parting mournful sorrowful downhearted of two men that night  their horses were not in the one enclosure that night their chariotdrivers were not at the one fire they rested that night there  and ferdiad rose up early next morning and went forward by himself to the ford for he knew that day would decide the fight and he knew one of them would fall on that day there or they would both fall  and then he put on his battle suit before the coming    of cuchulain to him he put on his shirt of striped silk with its border of speckled gold next his white skin he put on his coat of brown leather well sewed over the outside he put on his apron of purified iron through dread of the gae bulg that day he put his crested helmet of battle on his head on which were forty gems carbuncles in each division and it was studded with crystal and with shining rubies of the eastern world he took his strong spear into his right hand and his curved sword upon his left side with its golden hilt and its knobs of red gold and his great large bossed shield on his back  and then he began to show off many changing wonderful feats that he had never learned with any other person neither with nurse or with tutor or with scathach or with uacthach or with aoife but that were made up that day by himself against cuchulain  then cuchulain came to the ford and when he saw all ferdiad was doing: i see my friend laeg he said all those feats will be tried on me one after another and because of that he said if it is i that begin to give in today it is for you to reproach me and to speak hard words to me the way that the strength of my anger may grow the more on me but if i am getting the better of him you are to praise me and make much of me that my courage may be the greater i will do that indeed my master cuchulain said laeg  and then cuchulain put on his battle suit and he said: what arms shall we take today ferdiad the choice is yours today said ferdiad let us try the ford feat then said cuchulain let us indeed said ferdiad but though ferdiad agreed to it it is sorry he was to say those words for he knew cuchulain was used to put an end to every fighter that was against him in the feat of the ford  it was great work now that was done on that day at    the ford the two champions of western europe the two giftgiving and wagegiving hands of the northwest of the world the two pillars and the two keys of the courage of the gael to be brought from far off to fight one against the other through the stirring up and the meddling of ailell and maeve each of them began to throw his weapons at the other from the dawn of early morning to the middle of midday and when midday came the anger of the men grew hotter and each of them drew nearer to the other and then it was that cuchulain leaped on to the boss of ferdiads shield to strike at his head over the rim of the shield but ferdiad gave the shield a blow of the left elbow and threw cuchulain from him like a bird on the brink of the ford cuchulain leaped up again to the boss of the shield but ferdiad gave it a stroke of his left knee and threw cuchulain from him like a little child  laeg saw that done my grief indeed he said the fighter that is against you cuchulain casts you away as a light woman would cast her child he throws you as foam is thrown by the river he grinds you as a mill would grind fresh malt he cuts through you as the axe cuts through the oak he binds you as the woodbine binds the trees he darts on you as the hawk darts on little birds and from this out you have no call nor claim to courage or a brave name to the end of life and time you little fairy fighter said laeg  it is then cuchulain leaped up with the quickness of the wind and with the readiness of the swallow and with the fierceness of the lion towards the troubled clouds of the air the third time until he lit on the boss of ferdiads shield to strike at his head from above and ferdiad gave his shield a shake and cast cuchulain from him the same as if he had never been cast off before at all  and it is then cuchulains anger came on him and    the flames of the hero light began to shine about his head like a redthorn bush in a gap or like the sparks of a fire and he lost the appearance of a man and what was on him was the appearance of a god  so close was the fight they made now that their heads met above and their feet below and their hands in the middle over the rims and bosses of their shields so close was the fight that they broke and loosened their shields from the rim to the middle so close was the fight that they turned and bent and shattered their spears from the points to the hilts so close was the fight that the bocanachs and bananachs and the witches of the valley screamed from the rims of their shields and from the hilts of their swords and from the handles of their spears so close was the fight that they drove the river out of its bed and out of its course so that it might have been a place for a king or a queen to rest in so that there was not a drop of water in it unless it dropped into it by the trampling ad the hewing the two champions made in the middle of the ford  so great was the fight that the horses of the men of ireland broke away in fright and shyness with fury and madness breaking their chains and their yokes their ropes and their traces and the women and the young lads and the children and the crazy and the followers of the men of ireland broke out of the camp to the southwest  they were using the edge of their swords through that time and it was then ferdiad found a time when cuchulain was off his guard and he gave him a stroke of the sword and hid it in his body and the ford was reddened with cuchulains blood and ferdiad kept on making great strokes at him and cuchulain could not bear with this and he called to laeg for the gae bulg and it was sent down the stream to him and he caught it with his foot and when ferdiad heard the name of the gae bulg he made a stroke of his shield down to    protect his body but cuchulain made a straight cast of the spear the gae bulg off the middle of his hand over the rim of the shield and it passed through his armour and went out through his body so that its sharp end could be seen  ferdiad gave a stroke of his shield up to protect the upper part of his body though it was the relief after danger as the saying is that is enough said ferdiad i die by that and i may say indeed you have left me sick after you and it was not right that i should fall by your hand o hound of the beautiful feats it was not right you to kill me the fault of my death is yours it is on you my blood is a foolish man does not escape when he goes into the gap of danger my grief i am going away my end is come my ribs will not hold my heart my heart is all turned to blood i have not done well in the battle you have killed me cuchulain  cuchulain ran towards him after that and put his two arms about him and lifted him across the ford northwards so that his body should be by the ford on the north and not on the west of the ford with the men of ireland  he laid him down then and a cloud and a weakness came on as he stood over ferdiad laeg saw that and he saw that all the men of ireland were rising up to come towards him good cuchulain said laeg rise up now for the men of ireland are coming towards us and it is not one man they will put to fight against us now that ferdiad has fallen by you what use is it to me to rise up now and he after falling by me said cuchulain but laeg said: rise up o chained hound of emain it is glad and shouting you have a right to be now since ferdiad of the hosts has fallen by you what are joy and shouting to me now said cuchulain it is to madness and to grief i am driven after    the thing i have done and the body i wounded so hard it is not right for you to be lamenting him said laeg it is making rejoicings over him you should be it was at you he aimed his spears but cuchulain said: even if he had cut one arm and one leg from me it is my grief ferdiad not to be riding his horses through the long days of his lifetime and laeg said: it is better pleased the women of the red branch will be he to have died and you to be living they know it is not few but many you have sent away for ever for from the day you came out of cuailgne to meet maeve of the great name it is a grief to her all you have killed of her people and of her fighting men you have not taken quiet sleep since the spoiling of your country began though there were few along with you many were the mornings you rose up early  then cuchulain began to keen and to lament for ferdiad there and it is what he said: well ferdiad it is a pity for you it was not one of the men that knew my courage you asked an advice of before you came to meet me in the fight that was too hard for you it is a pity it was not laeg son of riangabra you asked how we stood one to another it is a pity you did not ask a true advice of fergus it is a pity it was not pleasant comely conall you asked which of us would put down the other  and these men know well he said there will never be born one among the men of connaught who will do deeds equal to yours to the end of life and time and they know that if they looked among the places the gatherings the swearings the false promises of the fairhaired women of connaught or in the playing with targets and shields the playing with shields and swords the playing backgammon and chess the playing with horses and chariots there will not be found the hand of a man that will wound like ferdiads hand or a man to    bring the redmouthed birds croaking over the speckled battle nor one that will fight for cruachan that will be your equal to the end of life and time o redcheeked son of daman and then he rose up and stood over ferdiad well ferdiad he said it is great wrong and treachery was played on you by the men of ireland to bring you out to fight with me for it has not been easy to stand against me in the war for the bull of cuailgne and he made this complaint:  o ferdiad you were betrayed to your death your last end was sorrowful you to die i to be living our parting for ever is a grief for ever  when we were far away with scathach the victorious we gave our word that to the end of time we would never go against one another  dear to me was your beautiful ruddiness dear to me your comely form dear to me your clear grey eyes dear to me your wisdom and your talk  there has not come to the battle there has not been made in the fight there has not held up shield on the field of spears the like of you o red son of daman  findabair the daughter of maeve with all her great beauty it was putting a gad on the sand or on the sun for you to think to get her ferdiad  then cuchulain was still looking down on ferdiad well my friend laeg he said strip ferdiad now and take his armour and clothes off him until i see the brooch for the sake of which he undertook the fight  laeg stripped ferdiad then and when cuchulain saw the brooch he began to lament and complain over him again and it is what he said:  my grief o gold brooch o ferdiad of the poets o strong striker of many blows it is brave your arm was    your yellow hair curled wellloved your soft leaflike belt about you until death  dear was our fellowship dear the brightness of your eyes your shield with its rim of gold your chessboard that was worth riches  it was not right you to fall by my hand it was not a friendly ending my grief o gold brooch my grief  well my friend laeg he said then come now and take the gae bulg out of him for i cannot afford to be without my spear so laeg took the gae bulg out of him and when cuchulain saw his reddened spear lying beside ferdiad he said: o ferdiad it is sorrowful story to me that i should see you so red and so pale i with my spear reddened and you in a bed of blood  when we were over in the east with scathach there would not have been angry words between us or destroying weapons  scathach spoke fiery words to us go all of you to the battle that will be fought by germain the terrible  i said to ferdiad and to lugaid the always generous and to the son of baetan the fair let us all go against germain  we all of us came to the battleground on the shore of the lake of lind formait we brought four hundred out with us from the islands of the athisech  as i and brave ferdiad were together in the door of germains dun i killed rind the son of niul i killed ruad son of finnial  ferdiad killed upon the shore blath son of calba of the red swords lugaid killed mugarne of the torrian sea a surly fierce man  we spoiled the dun of germain the crafty we brought him with us alive over the wide sea of speckled waters we brought him to scathach of the broadshield    she our teacher whose name was well known bound us to friendship together the way our anger would not turn against one another among the fair tribes of elga  sorrowful the morning when the strength was taken from the son of daman my grief i loved the friend to whom i have given a drink of red blood  it is a sorrowful thing has happened to us the pupils of scathachi myself red and wounded you yourself not driving your chariot it is a sorrowful thing has happened to us the pupils of scathachi myself hard with blood you yourself entirely dead  it is a sorrowful thing has happened to us the pupils of scathachyourself to have died myself to be alive and strong it is angry we were in the battle  good cuchulain said laeg let us leave this ford now it is too long we are here let us leave it now indeed my friend laeg said cuchulain but every other fight i ever made was as a game and a sport beside the fight with ferdiad and it is what he said:  each fight was a game each one was a jest until ferdiad came to the ford we got the same teaching we got the same rewards our teacher was kind to us both alike setting us both above all the others  each was as a game each was as a jest until ferdiad came to the ford we had the same ways we used to do the same deeds it was at the one time scathach gave a shield to me and a shield to ferdiad  each was a game each was a jest until ferdiad came to the ford dear to me was the pillar of gold that i broke down on the ford he who when he attacked the tribes was braver than any other  each was a game each was a jest until ferdiad    came to the ford like a proud swelling wave threatening to destroy all before him  each was a game each was a jest until ferdiad came to the ford this thing will hang over me for ever yesterday be was larger than a mountain today there is nothing of him but a shadow         cuchulain of muirthemne by lady augusta gregory  at sacredtextscom       xii     the awakening of ulster  then some of the men of ulster came to comfort cuchulain and among them were senoll uathach and the two sons of gege muredach and cotreb they brought him away to the five streams of conaille muirthemne to wash his hurts in them and the sidhe threw all sorts of herbs and plants into the streams for his healing so that they were all strewed over with green leaves  then when ailell and maeve heard there were men beginning to come from ulster they sent mac roth the herald to watch at slieve fuad and to warn them if he could see any one coming and after a while he came back and ailell asked news of him i saw he said one chariot only to the north of slieve fuad and it coming straight on and the man that was in it naked and without armour or weapons but only an iron spit in his hand and he goading on the horses as if he would never get to the army alive who do you think was that man fergus said ailell i think said fergus it was cethern son of fintan from the north and he will soon be upon us with that cethern came bursting into the camp and he attacked everyone he met with his spit and he himself got many wounds back again so that he had to hold up the board of the chariot to his body to keep his bowels from falling    out and at last he made his escape and came to the place where cuchulain was lying then cuchulain said to laeg: rise up now and go into the camp and bring some of ailells physicians to cure cethern for i give my word if they do not come before this time tomorrow i will bring death and destruction on them so laeg went and he brought back the physicians with him and it was only the dread of cuchulain that made them come then cethern showed the first one of them his wounds and it is what he said that he could not be cured then cethern gave him a blow that sent him out of the house and the same thing happened with all the rest fifteen there were of them altogether then he asked cuchulain would he get him another physician for those of the men of ireland had done him no good rise up laeg said cuchulain go to slieve fuad to fingan the druid physician of conchubar and bid him to come here and to heal cethern now fingan was the greatest physician in all ireland and it was said of him that he could tell what a persons sickness was by looking at the smoke of the house he was in and he knew by looking at a wound what sort the person was that gave it then he came and cethern showed him his wounds look at this wound for me good fingan he said there came at me two young men with clear noble looks with strange foreign clothes on them and each of them threw a spear into me and i threw my spear into each of them i know those two very well said cuchulain they are two choice men of norway and they were sent against you by ailell and maeve look at this wound for me fingan said cethern fingan looked at it that is the work of two brothers he said that is true indeed said cethern two young men came at me and they were like one another but one had curling    brown hair and the other had curling yellow hair two green cloaks about them with brooches of bright silver two soft shirts of yellow silk bright swords in their belts they had and shields with bright silver fastenings and spears with veins of silver on their handles i know those two very well said cuchulain they are maine athremail and maine mathremail two sons of ailell and maeve  look at this wound for me good fingan said cethern fingan looked at the wound and he said: it was a father and a son made that together that is true said cethern there came at me two large men with flaming eyes and they having gold bands on their heads and the dress of kings and gold swords at their sides i know those two very well said cuchulain it was ailell and his son maine andoe that gave you that wound look at this wound good fingan said cethern fingan looked at the wound that is the work of a proud woman he said that is true said cethern there came at me a beautiful pale longfaced woman with long flowing yellow hair on her a crimson cloak with a brooch of gold over her breast and a straight spear shining red in her hand it was she gave me that wound and she got a little wound from me i know that woman well said cuchulain she is maeve daughter of the high king of ireland and queen of connaught she would have thought it a great victory and a great triumph you to have fallen by her hand good fingan said cethern then tell me now what do you think of the way i am and what can you do for me it is what i think said fingan you will hardly see the calves that are following your cows at this time grow to be yearlings or if you do itself he said it will not be much use your life will be to you that is what all the others said to me said cethern and it is not much profit or credit they got    by it and it is not much you yourself will get and with that he made a kick at him to drive him out of the house but in spite of that treatment fingan gave him his choice of two things: the first to be a long time on his bed so that he would see the men of ulster coming in the end to avenge him or to be made well enough at the end of three days to go out himself and spend what he had of strength on his enemies  i will choose that he said for i would not like to leave my enemies after me and i would sooner get satisfaction from them myself so then fingan bade cuchulain to make a healing bath that would ease cethern so cuchulain went down to the camp and he brought away with him all that he met of the cattle of the men of ireland then their flesh was cut up with their bones and their skins to make a druid bath and cethern was put in it for the length of three days and three nights and at the end of that time he rose up and got into his chariot to do vengeance on the men of ireland and his wife ionda daughter of eochaid came to him from the north and brought him his sword that he had forgotten in his hurry at first setting out  but it happened that one of the physicians he had driven out with a blow had fallen down outside the tent and lay there not able to stir from that but when cethern was making ready to set out he rose up and made his way back to the camp and he said to the men of ireland: cethern is after being cured by fingan the druid and he is coming at you now and do you lay some trap for him so it is what they did: they took ailells cloak and shirt and they put them about the pillarstone at the boundary of ross and his crown on top of it and left them there cethern came rushing on them and when he saw the pillarstone he thought it was ailell was standing there and he made at it and    gave a great blow of his sword that it broke in pieces against the stone  then he saw what it was and he said: this is some trick they have played on me and by the oath of my people he said i will not stop my hand from killing until such time as i have killed some man having a dress like this  when maine andoe heard that he put on his fathers armour and came out to meet him and cethern saw him and made for him and threw his shield at him so that he was cut through and through the body by the rim of the shield  and when the men of ireland saw that they pressed on cethern from all sides and made an end of him and his wife ionda daughter of eochaid came and cried over him there     paragraph continues and it is what she said:  it is all one to me it is all one since there will be no hand of a man under my head for ever since a grave has been made in the earth for cethern from the dun of the two hills  cethern son of fintan he that was like a king was in no need of arms for his work with nothing in his hand but a twoheaded spit his anger did not spare the men of connaught  i will not take a mate for ever from the flocks of the living world i will not wed with a man my husband is sleeping with no woman  dear the little hill dear the dun where our fighting men were used to gather dear the sweet fair water dear was inis ruadh  pitiful the grief pitiful the grief the war for the bull has brought on me i will be keening him until my death i ionda daughter of eochaid      and then fintan cetherns father came with three times fifty men to get satisfaction for his son and he made three attacks on the army and killed a great many of ailells men but fintan lost a good many of his own men and his son crimthan was made prisoner and the men of ireland were afraid their army would be too much weakened by little fights of this sort before the great last battle that was foretold would come and they made an agreement with fintan to give him back his son and to fall back themselves a days march and he gave his word not to vex them again until the time of the last battle and they found where the fight had been one of fintans men and one of ailells men lying dead together and they with their teeth fixed into one another and it is from this the fight was given the name of fintans toothfight  then rochad son of fatheman came to help cuchulain and three times fifty men with him now findabair loved him and when she heard he was coming she told her secret and she said to her mother: that is    my love and my choice out of all the men of ireland and when maeve heard that she made a plan to draw him off and she said to findabair: if he is dear to you go and spend the night with him and bid him to go back with his men until the day of the great battle and i give you my leave to be his wife so findabair went and did as maeve bid her and he went back to the north but this was heard of in the camp and the twelve kings of munster that were in maeves army began speaking with one another and it is what they all said that maeve had secretly promised findabair as a wife to each one of them as a reward if he would join in the war and the best thing we can do now they said is to go and avenge ourselves on maeves men and on rochad for the treachery that was done on us  so they went out and made an attack on them and ailell and maeves men and rochad made ready to defend themselves but fergus went out and tried to make them leave off and to make peace between them and before he could do that seven hundred men had got their death  and it was told to findabair how these seven hundred men had got their death on account of her and how maeve had promised her in marriage to every one of the twelve kings of monster and when she heard that her heart broke with the shame and the pity that came on her and she fell dead there and then and they buried her  now at that time iliach son of cas of the race of rudraige was living in the north with his sons son laegaire buadach and it was told him how the four provinces of ireland were plundering and destroying the people of ulster since the day before samhain and driving off their cattle and their goods and all that they had so he consulted with his people and it is what he said that he would go out himself and make an attack    on the men of ireland and let loose his strength on them and destroy what he could of them and do what he could for ulster for as to myself he said if i come out of it or do not come out of it is all one to me then his two old spent horses that had been let loose for life were brought from where they were on the shore by the dun and yoked to his old chariot that had neither cushions nor skins in it and he took his rough dark iron shield with its hard rim of silver over his shoulder and his rough grey heavy sword at his left side and he put in the chariot his two rusty blunt spears and his people gave him a store of stones and bits of rocks in a heap about him and that is the way he went out against the army and no armour on him at all  when the men of ireland saw him coming that way they began mocking and laughing at him but it is what maeve said: i would be glad indeed all the men of ulster to come and meet us like that then doche son of magach chanced to meet him and bade him welcome who is it bids me welcome said iliach the comrade and friend of laegaire buadach said he doche son of magach i am glad of that welcome said iliach and for the sake of it let you come to me when i have spent my rage on the army and when my strength is going and when my hand is tired and let you and no other of the men of ireland make an end of me and keep my sword he said for your friend laegaire buadach  then be made an attack on the men of ireland and when his spears were all broken in pieces he began hitting and throwing with the stones he had and when they were out be attacked the men that were near him with the strength of his own hands so that he made an end of some of them and when all he could do was done he saw doche son of magach near him and he    said: come to me now doche and strike my head off and take charge of my sword for laegaire buadach and doche did as he bade him but he brought his head to ailell and to maeve  at this time sualtim son of roig was told that cuchulain had fought with calatin and his sons and with ferdiad and of the hard fight he had made and the wounds he had got and it is what sualtim said: is it the sky bursting i hear or is it the sea going backward or the earth breaking up or is it the groaning of my son in his weakness with that he set out to visit him and he found him covered with hurts and wounds and he began to cry over him but that did not please cuchulain and he knew sualtim would do no good by stopping there for he was not the man to avenge him for he was no great hero not that he was a coward but just like any other good fighting man and cuchulain said to him: well sualtim stop your crying over me and rise up and go to emain and tell the men of ulster they must come themselves and follow on with the war from this out for i am not able to defend them any more for after all i went through not one of them comes to help me or to comfort me and tell them he said what way you found me that i cannot bear to have my clothing next my skin but it is with crooks of hazel i have to hold it off me and it is grass that is laid over my wounds for there is not the place of the point of a needle on me from head to foot but has some hurt on it except my left hand that was holding my shield and tell them to make no delay in coming he said  then sualtim set out on the grey of macha to give his message and when lie got close to emain he called out: men are being killed women brought away cattle driven off in ulster but he got no word of answer then he went up to the very wall and he cried again: men are being killed women brought away cattle    brought away in ulster but the second time he got no answer then he went on to the stone of the hostages at emain and he called out the same words the third time then cathbad the druid asked: who are taken and who is it is taking them it is ailell and maeve that are robbing you and destroying you said sualtim they are bringing away your women your little boys your cattle and your horses and there is only cuchulain to delay and to hinder the four great provinces of ireland in the gaps and the passes of muirthemne the lad is wounded and no one is coming to his help but cathbad was vexed at being waked out of his sleep and he said: any man that comes to scold at the king this way has a right to be put to death but conchubar the king said: it is true what sualtim is saying it is true indeed said all the men of ulster  then anger came on sualtim that he got no better answer than that and he turned sharply and the grey of macha reared up the way the sharp edge of sualtims shield came against his own bead and cut it clean off then the grey turned again to emain and the shield dragged after him by its thongs and sualtims head in the hollow of it and the head said the same words as before: men are being killed women brought away cattle brought away in ulster then conchubar said: the sky is over our heads the earth is under our feet the sea is round about us and unless the sky with all its shower of stars comes down on earth or the earth breaks open under our feet or the blue sea goes over the whole face of the world i swear that i will bring back every cow to its own shed and every woman to her own dwellinghouse  then he called to one of his messengers finnched son of troiglethan that chanced to be there and he bade him to go and to call out the men of ulster but with the sleep that was on him still and the weakness    he bade him go and call those of his people that were dead as well as those that were living and one of the names he gave him to call to was cuchulain son of sualtim  it was easy work finnched had to do now for the men of ulster were rising from out of their weakness and they all made ready to come out with conchubar and some of them did not wait for conchubar at all but set out on the track of the army of ireland  then conchubar and his men set out from emain and the first day they went as far as irard cuillenn and there they made a halt what are we stopping here for said conchubar we are waiting for your own two sons his men said fiachna and fiacha that are gone to meet your grandson erc son of fedelm and of cairbre king of teamhair to bring him with us by my word said conchubar i will not make any more delay here for fear the men of ireland might hear i am risen from my weakness for they do not know it up to this he said or even if i am alive at all  so he himself and celthair and thirty hundred fierce chariotfighters went on and it was not long before they came on eight times twenty strong men belonging to ailell and to maeve and each of them bringing away a woman of the women of ulster with him and conchubar and celthair struck their heads off and set the women free and then they went back to irard cuillenn  now as to the men of ireland they spent that night at sleamhain of meath and in the night cormac conloingeas started up out of his sleep and he called out that there had a warning dream come to him and that there was a terrible battle before them and after a while dubthach the beetle of ulster started up out of his sleep and called out the same thing that there had a warning dream come to him and that it would not be long till there would be a great dashing of shields and with    these dreams and foretellings great fear came on the men of ireland and it was an uneasy night they spent at sleamhain that time  and in the morning ailell said: we have been harrying ulster and cuailgne this long time and we have taken the women and the cattle and the goods of the men of ulster and we have cut down hills behind us and now he said it is time for us to turn back to magh ai and they can follow us and fight with us there if they have a mind to but before that he said i will send a messenger to look out across the great plain of meath to see if any of them are coming against us and if they are he said i will not go from this without giving battle to them for he would not be a good king that would be good at running away  so he sent out mac roth the herald and he had not long to wait before he heard a noise that was like the falling of the sky or the breaking in of the sea over the land or the falling of trees on one another in a great storm and he saw the plain covered with wild creatures that had broken away out of the woods then he went back to ailell and to maeve and told them his story and they asked him what he had seen and he said: i thought i saw a grey mist far away across the plain and then i saw something like falling snow and then through the mist i saw something shining like sparks from a fire or like the stars on a very frosty night what was it he saw fergus said ailell and fergus said: the mist he saw was the dust that went up from the march of the men of ulster and the flakes of snow were the foam flakes from the bits of their horses and what he saw shining like sparks from the fire or like stars on a frosty night was the angry light of their eyes shining under their helmets  it is little i care for that said maeve we have good fighting men to meet them it is a pity for you    to think that said fergus for there is neither in alban nor in ireland an army that can put down the men of ulster when once their weakness is gone from them and their anger is kindled  that night the men of ireland made their camp in clartha and they put mac roth and another man to keep a good watch the way the men of ulster would not fall on them without warning now conchubar and celthair with their thirty hundred men had followed them to slieve sleamhain and when they found them gone from there they followed on to clartha for they thought to get the start of the rest of ulster in reddening their hands upon the men of ireland so mac roth was not long waiting when he saw men and horses coming from the northeast and he went back into the camp well mac roth said ailell have you seen any of the men of ulster on our track i saw men and horses coming be said what is the number of them said ailell not less than thirty hundred chariots those are the men of ulster coming with conchubar said ailell and what did you mean a while ago fergus threatening us with the dust of a great army in the plain when a little troop like that is all that can be brought against us you are too quick in complaining of that said fergus and you will soon know what their number is  let us make some good plan now said maeve for i am sure it is that hot rude man conchubar king of ulster that is coming to attack us let us make a pen before him she said of all the army standing round on three sides and thirty hundred men ready to shut the mouth of it on him when he comes in for we must take these fellows alive and not kill them for it would be unworthy of our name to do more than make prisoners of them and they so few now this was one of the most laughable things that was said in the whole    course of the war conchubar and his thirty hundred of the best men of ulster to be taken alive and when conchubars son cormac conloingeas heard this there was great anger on him and it is what he thought: if i do not get satisfaction now at once from maeve for this boast of hers i will never get it again so he rose up with his three thousand men to make an attack on her and on ailell and they rose up as well and their sons the maines along with them and the sons of magach but then the gailiana and the men of munster and of teamhair came between them and made peace and persuaded them to lay down their arms but for all that maeve did make a pen of the army of ireland to shut up conchubar and she had men ready to close it up when once he would be in but it is what conchubar did he never so much as looked for an opening but when he saw the army before him he went straight through it and he broke open a gap of two hundred on the right hand and a gap of two hundred on the left and went through them all and cut them down in the very middle so that eight hundred men of them were killed  and then he went away from them back to slieve sleamhain to join the army of ulster  then the men of ulster began to gather upon the plain in their full strength and when ailell heard it he said: let some one go up and watch them coming and bring us a report of the appearance that is on them and of the chief men that are leading them let mac roth go said fergus  so mac roth went out and took a post on the plain from the early light of the morning till the fall of evening and through all that time the men of ulster were coming so that the ground was not naked under them every division under its own chief man and every troop under its own lord and each one of them apart    from the others and they came on till they had covered the hill of sleamhain  and when evening came mac roth came back to ailell and to maeve and they questioned him and said: what sort were the men of ulster as they came across the plain and mac roth said: the first troop i saw coming had three thousand men in it and as soon as they got to the hill they took their armour off and they began to dig and to make a seat of sods and of earth on the highest part of the hill for their leader to sit on until the rest of the army would come  he had the appearance of a tall proud man used to giving orders and he had yellow curling hair on him and a yellow forked beard and a red pleasant face and blue eyes you would be afraid of a fivefolded crimson cloak he had on him and a gold pin over his breast and a white shirt with threads of gold woven into it next his body who was that man fergus said ailell he was conchubar son of fachtna and of ness high king of ulster there was a man stood beside him said mac roth with scattered white hair and a purple cloak and a shield with bosses of red brass and a long iron sword of foreign make and he looked up to the sky and threw his hand upwards and with that the clouds seemed like as if they were rushing at one another and fire came from them towards the men of ireland that was cathbad the druid said fergus and he trying by his enchantments to know how the battle would go tomorrow  i saw another man with conchubar said mac roth and he having a smooth dark face and white eyes in his head a long bronze rod in his hand and a little bell beside him and when he touched it with his rod all the people near him began to laugh who is that man said ailell it is easy to know that said fergus that is rocmid the kings fool there was    never trouble or tiredness on any man of ulster that he would not forget if he saw rocmid there came another troop then said mac roth and it is what i thought that the leader they had was the handsomest and the most comely of all the men of ireland tall and well formed deep redyellow hair he had his face wide at the top and narrow below thin red lips and grey eyes that were laughing a red and white cloak on him that the wind stirred as he walked a white shield with gold fastenings at his shoulder a long dark green spear in his hand who was that man fergus said ailell that man is himself half an army rochad son of fatheman from rachlainn in the north said fergus now this was the same rochad that findabair had loved there was another troop came then said mac roth and a quiet greyhaired man at the head of it a darkgreen longwoolled cloak he had about him and a white shirt and a silver belt around his waist and a bell branch at his shoulder he sat before king conchubar when he came to the hill and his whole company sat about him and the sound of his voice when he spoke before the king and when he was advising him was sweeter than a threecornered harp in the players hand who was that man fergus said ailell that was sencha the orator the bestspoken of all the men of the whole world and the peacemaker of the army of ulster said fergus and the whole of the men of the world from the rising to the setting of the sun he would pacify with his three fair words but by my word it is no cowardly or no peaceful counsel that man will give his king today but counsel of courage and of strength and of battle  there came another troop said mac roth and a man at the head of them and it would not be easy to find a man with better appearance or with hair more like gold than what he has there was a sword    with an ivory hilt in his hand and be throwing it up and catching it in his hand again as it was coming on the heads of the people near him that is aithirne the poet and satirist said fergus it was said now of that man that he was very covetous and that he would ask the oneeyed man for his one eye and that the rivers and the lakes went back before him when he made a satire on them and rose when he praised them and one time when the men of ulster were fighting to protect him against the men of leinster that he had stirred up and were shut up in beinn etair he had plenty of cows himself in the fort but he would not give a drop of milk to man or boy or to a wounded man itself but left them without food and without drink unless they would eat the clay or drink the salt water of the sea  i saw another troop coming said mac roth wildlooking and in the middle of it a young little lad red and freckled he had a silk shirt on him with a border of red gold and a shield faced with gold with a golden rim and a little bright gold sword at his side who is that fergus said ailell i do not remember leaving any such boy as that when i left ulster said fergus but it is likely it may be erc son of cairbre that has come without leave of his father to help his grandfather conchubar and the men of teamhair with him and if what i think is true he said you will find that troop to be a drowning sea and it is by that troop and by that little boy the battle will be won against you  now that was the same erc that fought afterwards in the last battle against cuchulain at muirthemne and some said it was he that made an end of cuchulain but others said it was only the grey of macha he made an end of and conall cearnach killed him afterwards in his red vengeance and his sister acaill came to teamhair where he was buried and cried for him through nine days till her heart broke like a nut inside    her and she desired that her grave and her mound should be made in a place where the grave and the mound of erc could be seen from it and it was made in the place that used to be called the place of the poet maine but that is called now the place of acaill  i saw another company said mac roth having at its head a tall large man with high looks with soft brown hair in smooth locks on his forehead a deep grey cloak wrapped around him having a silver brooch in it a soft white shirt next his skin i know that man said fergus he is eoghan son of durthact king of fernmaige one of the twelve chief heroes of the red branch  i saw another company coming said mac roth and a great many in it and they red with the fire of their anger strong and eager and destroying at their head an angry man dreadful to look at longnosed largeeared with coarse grey hair a striped cloak on him an iron skewer in place of a brooch a coarse striped shirt next his skin a great spear in his hand  i know that man said fergus celthair son of uthecar a head of battle in ulster and the spear in his hand is the great spear the luin that was brought back from the east by the three sons of tuireann  i saw the troop that came last said mac roth and it without a leader there were thirty hundred in it of proud clean ruddy men long fair hair they had and shining eyes and long shining cloaks with good brooches blue shining spears good coverings on their heads and shirts of striped silk but they seemed to have some great trouble on them and to be very downhearted what men are those fergus said ailell i know them well said fergus it is well for those on whose side they are and it is a pity for those they are against for they are able by themselves    he said to fight the whole army of ireland for they are cuchulains men from muirthemne     now all this time cuchulain was lying on his bed with the dint of his wounds but when he knew by the noise on the plain that the men of ulster were gathering for the battle he used all his strength and tried to rise up and he gave a great shout that all his own troop heard it and all the whole army but his people that were about him laid him down on the bed again by force and put ropes and fastenings over him the way he could not move from it to open his wounds again and as he was lying there two mocking women came from ailells camp and stood beside his bed and let on to be crying and lamenting and it is what they told him that the men of ulster were beaten and that conchubar was killed and that fergus was killed along with him and in the night the morrigu came like a lean greyhaired hag shrieking from the one army to the other hopping over the points of their weapons to stir up anger between them and she called out that ravens would be picking mens necks on the morrow and with all this outcry cuchulain could not sleep and when the day began to break he said to laeg: look out now and bring me word of everything that happens on this day so laeg looked out and he said: i see a little herd of cattle breaking out from the west of ailells camp and there are lads following after them and trying to bring them back and i see more lads coming out from the army of ulster to attack them that little herd on the plain is the beginning of a great battle said cuchulain for it is the brown bull of cuailgne and his heifers are in it and now the young men of the east and of the west will come out against one another and go now laeg he said for i cannot go out myself and call to the    men of ulster and stir them up to the battle so laeg went out and called to them in cuchulains name to get themselves ready and to come out to the battle  when the men of ulster heard that message from cuchulain they rose up and rushed out without stopping to put on their clothing but only taking their weapons in their hands and such of them as had the door of their tents facing eastwards did not wait to go through it but broke out to the west  but conchubar was not in such haste to bring his own men out but he said to sencha: keep them back till the right time will have corn when the sun will have lighted all the valleys and the hills  then laeg went to look out again and he saw the army of ireland coming out to meet the men of ulster and there began a great fight between them and it went on a good while without one side getting the better of the other and when cuchulain heard it he said: my grief i not to be able to go among them  now as to maeve she was sending out her men the three conaires from slieve lis the three red luachras the three nimble suibhnes the three skylike eochaids the three bards from lough riach the three fachtnas from the woods of navan the three sadfaced murroughs the three boiling laegaires the three dovelike conalls the three sons of driscoll that fought together the three fintans from beside the sea and some say that besides these there were three young men of the sidhe in shining armour that mixed through the army to stir up courage and that none of the men of the army could see among them delbhaeth son of eithlin and cermat honeymouth and angus og son of the dagda  but when maeve saw the battle going on and neither side getting the victory she called to fergus and she said: it is time for you fergus to go out and avenge    yourself on your enemy conchubar and besides that she said it is right for you to go and to fight for us now after all the good treatment you got from us in connaught i would go out willingly said fergus if i had my own sword again the caladcholg the sword that leite brought from the country of the sidhe then ailell said to his chariotdriver ferloga: go now and bring ferguss sword that i bade you to hide away so ferloga brought the sword and put it in ferguss hand and fergus gave it a great welcome come out now into the battle fergus said maeve and spare no one today unless it might be some very dear friend  then fergus and maeve and ailell went out into the battle and three times they made the army of ulster go back before them and when conchubar heard his people were being driven back he called out to the household of the red branch: let you hold the place i am in now till i go see who has turned back our men against us three times on the north side  and the men of the red branch called back to him: we will do that and unless the sky should fall on us or the earth give way under us we will not give up one inch of ground before the men of ireland till you come to us again or till we get our death  then conchubar went to see who it was that was driving back his army and it was fergus he found before him and fergus struck three great blows on conchubars shield the ochain so that the shield screamed out loud and all the shields of the army of ulster screamed with it and the three great waves of ireland answered it  then fergus said: who is it is holding his shield against me and conchubar knew then who was before him and he cried out: it is the man fergus that is greater and more comely and younger and better than yourself the man whose father and mother were better    than your own the man that put to death the three great candles of the valour of the gad the three prosperous sons of usnach in spite of your guarantee and your protection the man that banished you out of your own country the man that made your house a dwellingplace for deer and foxes the man that never left you so much as the breadth of your foot of land in ulster the man that drove you to the entertainment of a woman and the man that will drive you back today in the presence of the men of ireland conchubar son of fachtna fathach high king of ulster the high king of ireland  when fergus heard that he took his sword the caladcholg in his two hands and he was swinging it over his head that it seemed to have the size and appearance of a rainbow and he was about to give his three great strokes on the men of ulster  but conchubars son cormac conloingeas saw what be was doing and he made a rush at fergus and put his arms about his knees and be said: do not put out your great strength my master fergus to destroy the whole army of ulster let me go said fergus for i will not live through the day unless i strike my three blows on the men of ulster but cormac conloingeas would not leave off from asking him and then he said: tell conchubar to go back to his own place in the battle and i will spare the army so conchubar went back and then fergus struck his three blows on three little hills that were near him and cut their tops off and they are called the three bare hills of meath to this day  but when cuchulain heard the scream of conchubars shield the time fergus struck it he called out to laeg: who has dared to strike those three blows upon the ochain and i still living it is fergus son of rogh struck them said laeg where is the battle going on now said cuchulain the armies are come as far    as gairech said laeg by my hand of valour said cuchulain they will not have reached to ilgairech before i will be with them with that he put out all his strength and he broke the ropes that were about him and threw them off and he scattered the grass that was on his wounds into the high air and the two mocking women were there yet and he dashed them one against the other and left them there on the ground and he looked for his arms but he could see none of them but only his chariot that was broken was lying there and he took hold of a shaft of it and rushed with all his wounds straight into the battle till he found fergus and he called to him to go back before him now as he had promised he would do but fergus gave him no answer then cuchulain said: go back now fergus or by the oath of my people he said i will grind you to pieces as a mill grinds the malt then fergus said: do not be giving out threats to me for my army is well able for the army of ulster you gave me your promise fergus said cuchulain to go back before me when we would meet in the great battle and when i would be covered with wounds you bound yourself to that the time i went back before you and you without your sword  then fergus when he heard that went back three steps and then he turned and his men with him and gave way before cuchulain and all the men of ireland turned when they saw that and broke out of their ranks and ran over the hill westward and cuchulain and the men of ulster followed after them making a great slaughter and cuchulain came up with maeve and she called out: a gift to me cuchulain what is it you are asking of me he said take what is left of my army under your protection and let it pass over the great ford westward so he agreed to do that and what was left of the army of ireland went over the great    ford of the sionnan at athluain and maeve and ailell and fergus and the maines and the sons of magach stopped to the last and drew their shields of protection behind the men of ireland till they had got back to cruachan in connaught the place they set out from  it was midday when cuchulain came into the battle and the sun was setting when the last of them went over the ford and then cuchulain took his sword that laeg had brought him for he had but a few splinters left of the shaft of the chariot he had used in the fight and he made three blows at three rocks and cut the tops off them for an insult to connaught for ever the way if any one should speak of the three bare hills of meath the three bare rocks of athluain would be there to give the answer  and fergus was watching the army of ireland going back over the ford and it is what he said: this army is swept away today it is wandering and going astray like a mare among her foals that goes astray in a strange place not knowing what path to take and it is following the lead of a woman he said has brought it into this distress  this then was the end of the battle of gairech and ilgairech and the end of the war for the brown bull of cuailgne         cuchulain of muirthemne by lady augusta gregory  at sacredtextscom       xiii     the two bulls  this now is the story of the two bulls the brown of cuailgne and the whitehorned of cruachan ai and this is the way it was with themfor they were not right bulls but there was enchantment on them in the time long ago bodb was king of the sidhe of munster and it is in femen of slievenaman he was and ochall ochne was king of the sidhe of connaught and it is in cruachan he used to be they used at one time to be fighting one against the other but afterwards they made peace and were good friends now bodb had a swineherd whose name was friuch and ochall had a swineherd whose name was rucht and they were friendly with one another the same as their masters and they had the knowledge of enchantments and could turn themselves to every shape and when there was a great plenty of mast in munster the swineherd from connaught would bring his lean swine to the south and in the same way when mast was plentiful in connaught the swineherd would bring his swine northward and would bring them home again fat  but after a while some bad feeling rose up between the two for the men of connaught and the men of munster began to set them one against the other so one year when there was great mast in munster and rucht brought his herd from connaught so soon as his comrade friuch had bade him welcome he said: the    people are all saying your power is greater than mine it is no less any way said ochalls herd we will soon know that said friuch i will put an enchantment on your swine and even though they eat their share of mast they will not be fat like mine will be and so it happened he put an enchantment on the connaught swine and when rucht went home with them they could hardly walk at all they were so thin and so weak and all the people were laughing at the state they were in it was a bad day for you you went to the south they said for your comrade has greater power than what you have that is not so said he wait till it is our turn to have mast and i will play the same trick on him  so the next year he did as he had said and the munster swine pined away so that every one said their power was the same and when bodbs swineherd went back home to munster with his lean swine his master put him out of the place and ochall put his herd out of his place as well because of the swine coming back in so bad a state from munster  one day two full years after that the men of munster were gathered together near femen and they took notice of two ravens that were making a great cawing what a noise those birds have been making all through the year they said they never stop scolding at one another just then findell ochalls steward from cruachan came towards them on the hill and they bade him welcome what a noise those birds are making he said any one would think them to be the same two birds we had in cruachan last year with that they saw the two ravens change into the shape of men and they knew them to be the two swineherds and they bade them welcome it is not right you to welcome us said bodbs swineherd for there will be many dead bodies of friends and much crying on    account of us two what has happened you all through this time they asked nothing good he said since we went from you we have been all the time in the shape of birds and you saw the way we were scolding at one another all through this year and we were quarrelling in the same way the whole of last year at cruachan and the men of the north and of the south have seen what our power is and now he said we will go into the shape of water beasts and be under the water for the length of two years and with that one of them went into the sionnan and the other into the suir and they were seen for a year in the suir and for a year in the sionnan and they devouring one another and one day the men of connaught had a great gathering at ednecha on the sionnan and they saw these two beasts in the river each one of them looked to be as big as the top of a hill and they made such a furious attack on one another that fiery swords seemed to be coming from their jaws and the people came round them on every side they came out of the sionnan then and as soon as they touched the shore they changed again into the shape of the two swineherds ochall bade them welcome where have you been wandering he asked them indeed it is tired we are with our wanderings they said you saw what we were doing before your eyes and that is what we were doing through these two years under seas and waters and now we must take new shapes on us till we try one anothers strength again and with that they went away  it happened a good while after that there was a great gathering of the men of connaught at loch riach for bodb was coming on a friendly visit to ochall and bodb brought a great troop with him the most splendid ever seen speckled horses they had and green cloaks with silver brooches and shoes with clasps of red bronze    and every one of them had a collar of gold with a stone worth a newlycalved cow set in it when ochall saw what grand clothes and horses they had he called to his people secretly and asked could they match bodbs people in dress and in horses and aims and they said they could not then ochall said: that is a pity and our great name is lost but just then a troop of men were seen coming from the north and black horses with them that you would think had been cast up by the sea and bridlebits of gold in their mouths and the men bad blackgrey cloaks and a gold brooch at the breast of each and a white tunic with crimson stripes and fifty coils of bright gold round every man and every man of them had black hair as smooth as if a cow had licked it and they stopped a little way off and then the men of connaught stood up and gave up their place to them there was a druid from britain there and when he saw them make way he said: from this out to the end of life and time the connaught men will be under the yoke attending on hounds and on sons of kings and queens for ever  then after they had been feasting for a while bodb asked could any connaught man be found that would fight against his champion rinn that was with him and that had a great name but no one knew where he came from and at first there could no one be found but then a strange champion came out from among the men of connaught and he said i will go against him that is no welcome news said rinn then they fought against one another for three days and three nights and before the end of that time the two armies began to join into the fight and a troop came from leinster and joined with bodb and another troop came from meath and joined with ochall and four kings were killed there and ochall among them and then bodb went back to slievenaman but as to the    two champions they were seen no more and it was known they were the two swineherds after that they were for two years with the appearance of shadows threatening one another the way that many people died of fright after seeing them  and after that they were in the shape of eels and one went into the river cruind in cuailgne and after a while a cow belonging to daire son of fachna drank it down and the other went into the spring of uaran garad in connaught and one day maeve went out to the spring and a small bronze vessel in her hand and she dipped it in the water and the little eel went into it and every colour was to be seen on him and she was a long time looking at him she thought the colours so beautiful then the water went away and the eel was alone in the vessel it is a pity you cannot speak to me said maeve what is it you want to know said the eel i would like to know what way it is with you in that shape of a beast she said and i would like to know what will happen me after i get the sway over connaught indeed it is a tormented beast i am he said and it is in many shapes i have been and as to yourself he said handsome as you are you should take a good man to be with you in your sway i have no wish said maeve to let a man of connaught get the upper hand over me and with that she went home again  but she married ailell after that and as for the eel he was swallowed down by one of maeves cows that came to drink at the spring  and it was from that cow and from the cow that belonged to daire son of fachna the two bulls were born the whitehorned and the brown they were the finest ever seen in ireland and gold and silver were put on their horns by the men of ulster and connaught in connaught no bull dared bellow before the whitehorned    and in ulster no bull dared bellow before the brown  as to the brown he that had been friuch the munster swineherd his lowing when he would be coming home every evening to his yard was good music to the people of the whole of cuailgne and wherever he was neither bocanachs nor bananachs nor witches of the valley could come into the one place with him and it was on account of him the great war broke out  now when maeve saw at ilgairech that the battle was going against her she sent eight of her own messengers to bring away the brown bull and his heifers for whoever goes back or does not go back she said the brown bull must go to cruachan  now when the brown bull came into connaught and saw the beautiful trackless country before him he let three great loud bellowings out of him as soon as the whitehorned heard that he set out for the place those bellowings came from with his head high in the air  then maeve said that the men of her army must not go to their homes till they would see the fight between the two bulls  and they all said some one must be put to watch the fight and to give a fair report of it afterwards and it is what they agreed that bricriu should be sent to watch it because he had not taken any side in the war for he had been through the whole length of it under care of physicians at cruachan with the dint of the wound he got the day he vexed fergus and that fergus drove the chessmen into his head i will go willingly said bricriu so he went out and took his place in a gap where he could have a good view of the fight  as soon as the bulls caught sight of one another they pawed the earth so furiously that they sent the sods flying and their eyes were like balls of fire in    their heads they locked their horns together and they ploughed up the ground under them and trampled it and they were trying to crush and to destroy one another through the whole length of the day  and once the whitehorned went back a little way and made a rush at the brown and got his horn into his side and he gave out a great bellow and they rushed both together through the gap where bricriu was the way he was trodden into the earth under their feet and that is how bricriu of the bitter tongue son of cairbre got his death  then when the night was coming on cormac conloingeas took hold of a spearshaft and he laid three great strokes on the brown bull from head to tail and he said: this is a great treasure to be boasting of that cannot get the better of a calf of his own age when the brown bull heard that insult great fury came on him and he turned on the whitehorned again and all through the night the men of ireland were listening to the sound of their bellowing and they going here and there all through the country  on the morrow they saw the brown bull coming over cruachan from the west and be carrying what was left of the whitehorned on his horns then maeves sons the maines rose up to make an attack on him on account of the connaught bull he had destroyed where are those men going said fergus they are going to kill the brown bull of cuailgne by the oath of my people said fergus if you do not let the brown bull go back to his own country in safety all he has done to the whitehorned is little to what i wilt do now to you  then the brown bull bellowed three times and set out on his way and when became to the great ford of the sionnan he stopped to drink and the two loins of the whitehorned fell from his horns into the water    paragraph continues and that place is called athluain the ford of the loin to this day and its liver fell in the same way into a river of meath and it is called athtruim the ford of the liver to this day  then he went on till he came to the top of slieve breagh and when be looked from it he saw his own home the hills of cuailgne and at the sight of his own country a great spirit rose up in him and madness and fury came on him and he rushed on killing everyone that came in his way  and when he got to his own place he turned his back to a hilt and he gave out a loud bellowing of victory and with that his heart broke in his body and blood came bursting from his mouth and he died
