there lived once upon a time a great and famous king in emain macha whose name was conchobar son of fachtna  p  fathach in his reign there was much store of good things with the men of ulster peace there was and quiet and pleasant greeting there was fruit and fatness and harvest of the sea there was sway and law and good lordship during his time with the men of ulster there was great state and rank and plenty in the kings house at emain on this wise was that houseviz the red branch of conchobor after the likeness of the house of the midcourt nine beds were in it from the fire to the wall thirty feet was the height of each bronze front that was in the house carvings of red yew were therein it was a board  below and a roof of tiles above the bed of conchobor was in the front of the house with boards of silver with pillars of bronze with the glitter of gold on their headpieces and carbuncles in them so that day and night were equally light in it with its silver board above the king to the highest part of the royal house whenever conchobor struck the board with a royal rod all the men of ulster were silent thereat the twelve beds of the twelve chariotchiefs were round about that bed  yea the valiant warriors of the men of ulster found place in that kings house at the drink and no man of them would touch the other splendid lavish and beautiful were the valiant warriors of the men of ulster in that house there were great and numerous gatherings of every kind in that house and wonderful pastimes there were games and music and singing thereviz heroes were at their feats poets sang harpers and players on the timpan struck their sounds  now once the men of ulster were in emain macha with conchobor drinking the ierngual ironcoal a hundred fillings of beverage went into it every evening this was the drinking of the coal that would satisfy all the men of ulster at one time the chariotchiefs of ulster were performing on ropes stretched across from door to door in the house at emain fifteen feet and nine score was the size of that house the chariotchiefs were performing three featsviz the spearfeat and the applefeat and the swordedge feat  these are the chariotchiefs who performed those featsconall the victorious son of amorgen fergus son of roich  p  the overbold loegaire the victorious son of connad celtchar son of uthider dubthach son of lugaid cuchulaind son of soaldam scel son of barnene from whom the pass of barnene is named the warder of emain macha from him is the saying a story of scels for he was a mighty storyteller cuchulaind surpassed all of them at those feats for quickness and deftness the women of ulster loved cuchulaind greatly for his quickness at the feats for the nimbleness of his leap for the excellency of his wisdom for the sweetness of his speech for the beauty of his face for the loveliness of his look for there were seven pupils in his kingly eyes four of them in his one eye and three of them in the other he had seven fingers on either hand and seven toes on either of his two feet many were his gifts first his gift of prudence until his warriors flame appeared the gift of feats the gift of buanfach the gift of draughtplaying the gift of calculating the gift of soothsaying the gift of sense the gift of beauty but three faults had cuchulaindthat he was too young for his moustache had not grown and all the more would unknown youths deride him that he was too daring that he was too beautiful  the men of ulster took counsel about cuchulaind for their women and maidens loved him greatly for there was no wife with cuchulaind at that time this was the counsel that they would seek a woman whom cuchulaind might choose to woo for they were sure that a man who had a wife to attend to him would less ravish their maidens and accept the love of their women and besides they were troubled and afraid that cuchulaind would perish early so that for that reason they wished to give him a wife that he might leave an heir for they knew that his rebirth would be of himself  then conchobor sent out nine men into each province of erinn to seek a wife for cuchulaind to see if they would find in any dun or in any chief place in erinn the daughter of a king or of a chief or of a lord of land whom cuchulaind might be pleased to choose and woo all the messengers returned that day a year gone and had not found a maiden whom cuchulaind chose to woo  thereupon cuchulaind himself went to woo a maiden that he knew in luglochta logaviz emer the daughter of forgall the wily then cuchulaind himself and his charioteer loeg son of riangabar or reincobir went in his chariot that was the one chariot which the host of the horses of the chariots of ulster could not follow on account of the swiftness and speed of the chariot and of who sat in it  then cuchulaind found the maiden  p  on her playing field with her fostersisters around her these were daughters of the lords of land that lived around the dun of forgall they were learning needlework and fine handiwork from emer she was the one maiden whom he deigned to address and woo of the maidens of erinn for she had the six giftsviz the gift of beauty the gift of voice the gift of sweet speech the gift of needlework the gift of wisdom the gift of chastity cuchulaind said that no maiden should go with him but she who was his equal in age and shape and race and skill and deftness who was the best handworker of the maidens of erinn and that none was a fitting wife for him unless such were she and as she was the one maiden that fulfilled all those conditions cuchulaind went to woo her above all it was in his festal array that cuchulaind went on that day to address emer and to show his beauty to her as the maidens were sitting on the bench of gathering at the dun they heard something coming towards them the clatter of the horses hoofs the creaking of the chariot the cracking of the straps the grating of the wheels the rush of the hero the clanking of the weapons let one of you see said emer what it is that is coming towards us  truly i see here said fiall daughter of forgall two steeds of like size beauty fierceness and speed

face and recognised cuchulaind and then she said: may god make smooth the path before you may you be safe from every harm said he whence hast thou come she asked from intide emna he replied where did you sleep said she we slept he said in the house of the man who tends the cattle of the plain of tethra what was your food there she asked the ruin of a chariot was cooked for us there he replied which way didst thou come said she between the two mountains of the wood said he which way didst thou take after that said she not hard to tell said he from the cover of the sea over the great secret

tell his many powers he is stronger than any labourer more learned than any druid sharper than any poet it will be more than all your games to fight against forgall himself for many powers of his have been recounted  of manly deeds  why dost thou not reckon me oh maiden with those strong men said cuchulaind if thy deeds have been recounted why should i not reckon thee among them truly i swear oh maiden said cuchulaind that i shall make my deeds recounted among the glories of the strength of heroes what then is thy strength said emer not hard to tell truly said he when i am weak in fight i defend twenty sufficient for thirty is a third of my strength i alone make combat against forty my protection guards a hundred fords and battlefields are avoided for fear and dread of me hosts and multitudes and many armed men flee with the terror of my face  those are good fights of a tender boy said the maiden but thou hast not yet  p  reached the strength of chariotchiefs truly oh maiden said he well have i been brought up by my dear fosterfather conchobor not as a churl looks to the heritage of his children not between flagstone and kneadingtrough nor from the fire to the wall nor on the floor of the one larder  have i been brought up by conchobor but among chariotchiefs and champions among jesters and druids among poets and learned men among the lords of land and farmers of ulster have i been reared so that i have all their manners and gifts who then have brought thee up in all those deeds thou boastest said emer not hard to tell truly fairspeeched sencha has taught me so that i am strong wise swift deft  i am wise in judgments i am not forgetful i  anybody before wise men i attend to their speeches i direct the judgments of all the men of ulster and do not alter them through the training of sencha blai the lord of lands took me to himself on account of the kinship of his race so that i got my due with him so that i invite the men of conchobors province with

the host and multitude so  p  that i fight for the honour of them all alike honourably have i been asked by lug son of cond son of ethlend  of dechtire to the house  of the brug and thou oh maiden said cuchulaind how hast thou been reared in luglochta loga p  not hard to tell truly answered the maiden i was brought up said she in ancient virtues in lawful behaviour in keeping chastity in equal  of a queen in stately form so that to me is attributed every noble stately form among the hosts of  women good are those virtues truly said cuchulaind why then said he should it not be fitting for us both to become one for i have not hitherto found a maiden capable of holding converse with me at a meeting in this wise a question hast thou a wife said the maiden for under my protection  after thee not so said cuchulaind i may not marry said the maiden before the sister who is older than i am viz fial daughter of forgall whom thou seest near me here she is an excellent handworker it is not she truly with whom i have fallen in love said cuchulaind nor have i ever accepted a woman that has known a man before me and i have been told that yonder girl has slept with carpre niafer once  while they were thus conversing cuchulaind saw the breasts of the maiden over the bosom of her smock then he said: fair is this plain the plain of the noble yoke then the maiden spoke these words: no one comes to this plain said emer who does not slay as many as a hundred comainm naircid on each ford from the ford of scennmenn at ollbine to banchuing arcait where swift brea breaks the brow of fedelm fair is this plain the plain of the noble yoke said cuchullaind no one comes to this plain said she who has not achieved the feat of slaying three times nine men with one blow genid grainde oh calf of the cow  so as to preserve a man in the midst of each nine of them fair is this plain the plain of the noble yoke said cuchulaind no one comes to this plain said she who does not meet benn suain the son of roscmelc from summers end to the beginning of spring from the beginning of spring to mayday from mayday to the beginning of winter it is said it shall be done said cuchulaind it is offered it is granted it is taken it is accepted said emer a question what is the account of thee said she i am the nephew nia of the man that disappears in another in the wood of badb said he and what is thy name said she: i am the hero nadu of the plague that befalls dogs said he  p  after those noble words cuchulaind went from them and they did not hold any further converse on that day when cuchulaind was driving across bray loeg his charioteer asked him: now said he the words which thou and the maiden emer spoke what did you mean by them dost thou not know answered cuchulaind that i am wooing emer and it is for this reason that we disguised our words lest the girls should understand that i am wooing her for if forgall knew it we should not meet with his consent  cuchulaind then repeated the conversation from the beginning to his charioteer explaining it to him to beguile the length of their wayby intide emna which i said when she asked me whence hast thou come i meant from emain macha it is called emain macha from this macha the daughter of sainreth mac in botha wife of crundchu son of agnomon ran a race against two steeds of the king after she had been forced to it by a strong injunction she beat them and bare a boy and a girl at one birth and from those twins emuin is called and from that macha is named the plain of macha  or again it is from this that emain macha is as it is in the following tale three kings were reigning together over erinn they were from ulster viz dithorba son of diman from uisnech of meath aed the red son of badurn son of aircet the bald in the land of aed cimbaeth son of findairget from finnabair of mag inis it is he who brought up ugaine the great son of eochu the victorious then the men made an agreement that each of them was to reign seven years three times seven sureties were pledged between them seven druids to revile them forever or seven poets to lampoon and satirise and upbraid them seven chiefs to wound them and burn them unless each man gave up his reign at the end of seven years having preserved true government viz the produce of each year without decay of any kind and without the death of a woman from concubinage each of them reigned three times in his turn during sixtysix years aed the red was the first of them to die or rather he was drowned in ess ruaid and his body was taken into the sid there whence sid aeda and ess ruaid he left no children except one daughter whose name was macha the redhaired she demanded the kingship in its due time cimbaeth and dithorba said they would not give kingship to a woman a battle was fought between them macha routed them she was sovereign for seven years meanwhile dithorba had fallen he left five noble sons behind baeth and brass and betach uallach and borbchass these now demanded  p  the kingship macha said she would not give it to them for not by favour did i obtain it said she but by force in the battlefield a battle was fought between them macha routed the sons of dithorba who left a slaughter of heads before her and went into exile in the wilds of connaught macha then took cimbaeth to her as her husband and leader of her troops when now macha and cimbaeth were united macha went to seek the sons of dithorba in the shape of a leper viz she smeared herself with ryedough and   she found them in buirend connacht cooking a wild boar the men asked tidings of her and she gave them and they let her have food by the fire said one of them: lovely is the eye of the girl let us lie with her he took her with him into the wood she bound that man by dint of her strength and left him in the wood she came back to the fire where is the man who went with thee they asked he is ashamed to come to you she replied after having lain with a leper there is no shame said they for we shall all do the same each man took her into the wood she bound every one of them one after the other and brought them all in one chain to ulster the men of ulster wanted to kill them no said she for that would be the ruin of my true government but they shall be thralls and shall dig a rath round me and that shall be the eternal seat of ulster for ever then she marked out the dun for them with her brooch viz a golden pin on her neck ie a brooch on the neck of macha eo imma muin macha hence is emain macha in truth the man i said in whose house we slept he is the fisherman of conchobor roncu is his name it is he that catches the fish on his line under the sea for the fish are the cattle of the sea and the sea is the plain of tethra a king of the kings of the fomori  the cookinghearth i said a foal was cooked for us on it a foal is the ruin of a chariot to the end of three weeks  and there is a gess on a chariot to the end of three weeks for any man to enter it after having last eaten horseflesh for it is the horse that sustains the chariot  between the two mountains of the wood i said these are the two mountains between which we came viz sliab fuait to the west of us and sliab cuilinn to the east of us we were in oircel between them ie the wood which is between them viz on the road i meant between the two  p  the road i said viz from the covering of the sea ie from the plain of murthemne the sea was on it for thirty years after the deluge whence is teme mara ie the shelter or covering of the sea or again it is from this that it is called the plain of murthemne viz a magic sea was on it with  in it so that one could sit on it so that a man with his armour might sit down on the ground of  until the dagda came with his club of anger and sang the following words at it so that it ebbed away at once:  silent thy hollow head silent thy dirty body silent thy  brow over the great secret of the men of dea ie a wonderful secret and a wonderful whisper it is called the marsh of dolluid today dolluid son of carpre niafer was wounded by matu before that however its name was great secret of the men of dea because it was there that the gathering of the battle of moytura was first planned by the tuatha de danann for the purpose of throwing off the tribute which the fomori exacted from them viz twothirds of corn and milk and offspring  over the foam of the two steeds of emain there was a famous youth reigning over the gaels he had two horses reared for him in sid eremon of the tuatha dea nemed son of nama was the name of that king then those two horses were let loose from the sid and a splendid stream burst after them from the sid and there was great foam on that stream and the foam spread over the land for a great length of time and was thus to the end of a year so that hence that water was called uanub ie foam on the water and it is uanub today  the garden of the morrigan i said that is ochtur netmon the dagda gave that land to the morrigan and she lived there after a year she killed ibor boiclid son of garb in her garden the  which her garden grew were  in that year for the son of garb was her relation  the back of the great sow i said that is druimm nebreg for the shape of a sow appeared to the sons of milid on every hill and on every height in erinn when they came over and wanted to land in it by force after a spell had been cast on it by the tuatha de danann  the glen of the great dam i said ie glenn mbreogain viz glenn mbreogain and moy bray were named after breoga son of breogann sendacht son of milid it was called glen of the great  p  dam because dam of dile son of smirgoll son of tethra who was king over erinn lived there this dam died in  a woman  of moy bray to the west to the mouth   the road i said between the god and his seer viz between mac oc of the sid of the brug and his seer viz bresal was a seer to the west of the brug between them was the one woman the wife of the smith that is the way i went mairne then is between the hil of the sid of the brug in which oengus is and the sid of bresal the druid  over the marrow of the woman fedelm i said ie the boyne it is called boyne from boand the wife of nechtan son of labraid she went to guard the hidden well at the bottom of the dun with the three cupbearers of nechtan viz flex and lesc and luam nobody came without blemish from that well unless the three cupbearers went with him the queen went out of pride and overbearing to the well and said nothing would ruin her shape nor put a blemish on her she passed lefthandwise round the well to deride its power then three waves broke over her and smashed her two thighs and her right hand and one of her eyes she ran out of the sid to escape from this injury until she came to the sea wherever she ran the well ran after her segais was its name in the sid the river segsa from the sid to the pool of mochua the arm of the wife of nuadu and the thigh of the wife of nuadu after that the boyne in meath manchuing arcait it is called from the finda to the troma the marrow of the woman fedelm from the troma to the sea  the boar triath i said and his dam that is cleitech and fessi for triath is the name for a boar the leader of herds but it is also a name for a king the leader of the great host cleitech then is  of battle fessi again is a name for a great sow of a farmers house a boar and his dam and between a boar and his sow then we went  the king of ana i said and his servant gnia ie cerna through which we passed sid cirine was its name of old cerna is its name since the  viz enna aignech slew cerna the king of ana on that hill and he slew his steward in the east of that place gnia was his name from which is rath gniad in cerna ever on gese the king of the sons of emne did enna do it for there was great friendship between gese and cerna  the washing of the horses of dea i said ie ange the washing of the horses of dea was its name originally because in it the men of dea washed their horses when they came from the  p  battle of moytura it was called ange after the king whose horses the tuatha de danann washed in it the fourcornered mannchuile i said that is muin chille it is there where mann the farmer was there was a great mortality of cattle in erinn in the reign of bresal brecc son of fiachu fobrecc of leinster then mann made large deep chambers underground in the place which is called uachtar mannchuile today and  were made to keep off the plague afterwards he gave an entertainment to the king with twentyfour couples to the end of seven years mannchuile then are the corners of mann ie ochtar muinchille  great crime again i said ie ailbine there was a famous king here in erinn viz: ruad son of rigdond of munster he had an appointment of meeting with foreigners he went to the meeting with the foreigners round the south of alba  with three ships thirty were in each ship the fleet was arrested from below in the midst of the sea throwing jewels and precious things into the sea did not get them off lots where cast among them for who should go into the sea and find out what it was that held them fast the lot fell upon the king himself then the king ruad son of rigdond leapt into the sea the sea at once closed over him he lighted upon a large plain on which nine beautiful women met him they confessed to him that it had been they that had arrested the ships in order that he should come to them and they gave him nine vessels of gold to sleep with them for nine nights one night with each of them he did so meanwhile his men were not able to proceed quickly through the power of the women said one woman of them it was her time of conceiving and she would bear a son and he would come to them to fetch his son on his return from the east then he joined his men and they went on their voyage they stayed with their friends to the end of seven years and then went back a different way and did not go near the same spot and they landed in the bay of ailbine there the women came up to them the men heard their music in their brazen ship while they were stowing their fleet the women came ashore and put the boy out of their ship on the land where the men were the harbour was stony and rocky then the boy  one of the stones so that he died of it the women saw it and cried all together: ollbine ollbine ie great crime hence it is called ailbine  p  the remnants of the great feast i said that is taillne it is there that lug scimaig gave the great feast to lug son of ethle to comfort him after the battle of moytura for that was his wedding feast of kingship for the tuath dea made this lug king after nuada been killed as to the place in which their remnants were put he made a large hill of them the name was knoll of the great feast or remnants of the great feast ie taillne today  of the daughters of tethras nephew viz forgall the wily is the nephew of tethra king of the fomori viz the son of his sister for nia and a sisters son is the same and a champion is also called nia  as to the account of myself i gave her there are two rivers in the land of ross conchobor is the name of one of them and dofolt ie without hair bald the name of the other now the conchobor falls into the dofolt viz it mixes with it so that they are one river i am the nephew nia of that man viz of conchobor ie i am the son of dechtire conchobors sister or i am a champion of conchobors  in the wood of badb ie of the morrigu for that is her wood viz the land of ross and she is the battlecrow and is called the wife of neit ie the goddess of battle for neit is the same as god of battle  the name i said i had: i am the hero nadu of the plague that befals dogs i am nadu ie i am a strong warrior of that plague viz i am wild and fierce in battles and fights  p  when i said: fair is this plain the plain of the noble yoke it was not the plain of bray that i praised then but the shape of the maiden for i beheld the yoke of her two breasts through the opening of her smock and it is of that i said plain of the noble yoke of the breasts of the maiden  when she said: no one comes to this plain who does not kill as many as argat viz argat in the language of the poets means a hundred that is the interpretation and this is what it means that it is not easy to carry off the maiden unless i slay a hundred men at each ford from ailbine to the boyne together with scennmenn the wily the sister of her father who will change herself into every shape there to destroy my chariot and to bring about my death said cuchulaind  geni grainde she said ie she would not come with me unless i jumped the heros salmonleap across the three ramparts to reach her for three brothers of hers will be guarding her viz ibur and scibur and catt and a company of nine each of them and i must deal a blow on each nine from which eight will die but no stroke will reach any of her brothers among them and i must carry her and her fostersister with their load of gold and silver out of the dun of forgall  bend suain son of rosc mele which she said this is the same thing viz that i shall fight without harm to myself from samuin ie the end of summer for two divisions were formerly on the year viz summer from beltaine the first of may and winter from samuin to beltaine or sainfuin viz suain sounds for it is then that gentle voices sound viz smson gentle sound to oimolc ie the beginning of spring viz different ime is its wet folc viz the wet of spring and the wet of winter or oimelc viz oi in the language of poetry is a name for sheep whence oib sheeps death is named ut dicitur coinb dogs death echb horses death duineba mens death as bath is a name for death oimelc then is the time in which the sheep come out and are milked whence oisc a ewe ie oisc viz barren sheep to beldine ie beltine viz a favouring fire for the druids used to make two fires with great incantations and to drive the cattle between them against the plagues every year or to beldin viz bel the name of an idol at that time the young of every neat were placed in the possession of bel beldine then beltine to brn trogaill ie lammasday viz the beginning of autumn for it is then the earth is afflicted viz the earth under fruit trogam is a name for earth  p  cuchulaind went driving on his way and slept that night in emain macha then their daughters told the lords of land of the youth that had come in his splendid chariot and of the conversation which he and emer had held that they did not know what they had said to one another and that he had turned from them across the plain of bray northward then the lords of land tell forgall the wily that and that the girl had spoken to him it is true said forgall the wily the madman from emain macha has been here to converse with emer and the girl has fallen in love with him and that is why they talked to one another but it shall avail them nothing i shall hinder them from getting what they wish  thereupon forgall the wily went towards emain macha in the garb of a foreigner as if it were an embassy from the king of the foreigners that came to confer with conchobor with an offering to him of golden treasures of the white foreigners and all sorts of good things besides their number was three great welcome was made to him then when he had sent away his men on the third day cuchulaind and conall and other chariotchiefs of the men of ulster were praised before him he said that it was true and that the chariotchiefs performed marvellously but that were cuchulaind to go to domnall the soldierly in alba his skill would be the more marvellous and if he went to scathach to learn soldierly feats he would excel the warriors of all europe but it was for this that he proposed it to cuchulaind that he might not come back again for he thought that if cuchulaind was in her friendship he would get death thereby through the wildness and fierceness of the warrior yonder and   cuchulaind consented to go and forgall bound himself that were he to go in that time he would give to cuchulaind whatever he wished forgall went home and the warriors arose in the morning and set themselves to do what they had vowed they went namely cuchulaind and loegaire the victorious and conchobor and conall cernach say some went with them  cuchulaind then went across bray to visit the maiden he spoke with emer before he went in his ship the maiden told him that it was forgall who had desired him in emain to go to learn soldierly feats in order that emer and he might not meet and she told him to be on his guard wherever he went lest he should destroy him each of them promised the other to keep their chastity until they met again unless either of  p  them should get death thereby they bade farewell to each other and he turned towards alba when they had arrived at domnalls they were taught by him to blow a leathern bellows under the flagstone of the small hole they would perform on it till their soles were black or livid they were taught another thing on a spear on which they would jump and perform on its point viz the champions coiling round the points of spears or dropping on its head then the daughter of domnall dornolla by name fell in love with cuchulaind her form was very gruesome her knees were large her heels turned before her her feet behind her big darkgrey eyes in her head her face as black as a bowl of jet she had a very strong forehead her rough brightred hair in threads round her head cuchulaind refused to lie with her then she swore to be revenged on him for this  domnall said cuchulaind would not have true knowledge of what was taught until he went to scathach who lived eastward of alba so the four went across alba viz cuchulaind and conchobor the king of ulster and conall cernach and loegaire the victorious then before their eyes appeared unto them emain macha now conchobor and conall and loegaire were not able to go past it the daughter of domnall had raised that vision in order to sever cuchulaind from his companions to his ruin  this is what other versions say that it was forgall the wily who raised this vision before them to make them turn back so that cuchulaind through his returning should not fulfil what he had promised him in emain and thus would he be shamed thereby or were he peradventure to go east to learn soldierly feats both known and unknown  of aife he should all the more get death through being alone  then of his own will cuchulaind went away from them on an unknown road  for the powers of the girl were great and she wrought evil against him and severed him from his companions now when cuchulaind went across to alba he was sad and gloomy and weary for the loss of his comrades for he knew whither he should go to seek scathach for he had promised his comrades not to return again to emain unless he had reached scathach or found death when he saw that he was astray and ignorant he lingered  while he was there he beheld a terrible great beast like a lion coming towards him which kept regarding him nor did him any harm whatever way he went the beast went before him and moreover it turned its side towards him then he took a leap and was on its neck he did not guide it then but went wherever the  p  beast liked four days they went in that wise until they came to the bounds of dwellers and to an island where lads were rowing on a small loch they laughed at the unwonted sight of the hurtful beast yonder doing service to a man cuchulaind then leaped off and the beast parted from him and he blessed it p  he then went on and came to a large house in a great glen there he met a maiden of fair make in the house the maiden addressed him and bade him welcome welcome thy coming oh cuchulaind said she he asked whence she knew him she answered that they both had been dear fosterchildren with ulbeccan sexa when i was there and thou learning sweet speech from him said she the maiden gave him to drink and to eat and then he turned from her  he then met a brave youth who made the same welcome to him they exchanged converse between them cuchulaind was asking to know the way to the dun of scathach the youth taught him the way across the plain of illluck which lay before him on the hither half of the plain the feet of men would stick fast on the further half the grass would rise and hold them fast on the points of its blades the youth gave him a wheel and told him to follow its track thence across onehalf of the plain then he gave him an apple and told him to follow the ground where the apple would run and that in such wise he would reach the far end of the plain thus cuchulaind went across the plain he then proceeded further the youth had also told him there was a large glen before him and a single narrow path through it which was full of monsters that had been sent by forgall to destroy him and that was his road to the house of scathach across terrible high strong districts  each of them then wished a blessing to the other cuchulaind and the youth eochu bairche he it was who taught him how he should win honour in the house of scathach the same youth also foretold him what he would suffer of hardships and straits in the cattlespoil of cualgne he also told him what evil and exploits and contests he would achieve against the men of erinn  then cuchulaind went on that road across the plain of illluck  p  and through the perilous glen as the youth had taught him this was the road which cuchulaind took to the camp where the scholars of scathach were he asked where she was in yonder island said they which way must i go to her said he by the bridge of the cliff said they and no man can cross it before he has achieved valour for on this wise was that bridge it had two low heads and the mid space and whenever anybody would leap on its one head the other head would lift itself up and throw him on his back this is what some versions relate here that a crowd of the warriors of erinn were in that dun learning feats from scathach viz ferdia son of daman and noise son of usnech and lochmor son of egomas and fiamain son of fora and an innumerable host besides but it is not told in this version that they were there at that time cuchulaind then tried three times to cross the bridge and could not do it the men jeered at him then he grew mad and jumped on the head of the bridge and made the heros salmon leap so that he got on its midst and the other head of the bridge had not yet fully raised itself when he reached it and threw himself from it and was on the ground of the island he went to the dun and struck the door with the shaft of his spear so that it went through it scathach was then told true said she someone who has achieved valour somewhere else and from her she sent her daughter to know who the youth was then uathach the daughter of scathach went forth she looked at him but did not speak to him so much did the striking shape which she saw on the youth move her desire she went back to where her mother was and praised to her the man whom she had seen the man has pleased thee said her mother i see it by thee it is true said the maiden he has pleased me said she but sleep thou with him tonight if that is what thou askest it is indeed not unpleasant to me said scathach if it be thy own will  then the maiden served him with water and food and looked to his pleasure she made him boldly welcome in the shape of a servant  viz profiting by it cuchulaind took hold of her and broke her finger the maiden shrieked the whole household came to help and the people of the dun also then arose also a champion against him viz cochar cruifne a warrior of scathachs he and cuchulaind attacked each other and fought together for a long time then the champion remembered his feats of valour and cuchulaind returned them as if he had been taught them from his youth and the champion fell by him and he struck his head off sorrowful was the woman scathach at this then cuchulaind said to her he  p  would take upon himself the work and service of the man that had fallen so that he was the leader of her host and her champion in his stead and uathach then came and conversed with cuchulaind on the third day the maiden advised cuchulaind that if it was to achieve valour that he had come he should go through the heros salmonleap at scathach where she was teaching her two sons cuar and cett in the great yew tree when she was there that he should then set his sword between her two breasts until she gave him his three wishes viz to teach him without neglect and that he might wed her uathach without the payment of the wedding gift and to tell him what would befall him for she was a prophetess  then cuchulaind went to the place where scathach was he placed his two feet on the two edges of the basket of the cless and bared his sword and put its point to her heart saying: death over thee said he thy three wishes from me said she viz thy three wishes as thou canst utter them in one breath they shall be taken said cuchulaind he then pledged her other versions say here cuchulaind took scathach with him to the shore and lay with her there and slept with her and that it was then that she sang this prophesying to him everything that would befal him saying: welcome oh   etc but that is not told thus after this account  uathach then slept with cuchulaind and scathach taught him skill of arms during the time that he was with scathach and the husband of uathach her daughter a certain famous man who lived in munster viz lugaid son of nos son of alamac the renowned king and fosterbrother of cuchulaind went eastward with twelve chariotchiefs of the high kings of munster to woo twelve maidens of the men of mac rossa all these were betrothed to men before when forgall the wily heard this he went to tara and said to lugaid that the best maiden in erinn both in shape and chastity and handiwork was living with him unmarried lugaid said it pleased him well then forgall betrothed the maiden to the king and the twelve daughters of the twelve lords of land in bray besides to the twelve underkings that were together with lugaid  the king went along with forgall to his dun for the wedding when now emer was brought to lugaid to sit by his side she took in both her hands his two cheeks and laid it on the troth of his honour and his life and confessed that it was cuchulaind she loved that forgall was against it that it was loss of honour for anyone to take her to wife then from fear of cuchulaind  p  lugaid did not dare to sleep with emer and he returned home again scathach was at that time carrying on war against other tribes over which the princess aife was ruling then the two hosts assembled to fight cuchulaind was put in bonds by scathach and a sleeping potion had been given him before that he might not go to the battle lest anything should happen to him there as a precaution  she did this then forthwith out of his sleep started cuchulaind after an hour while anybody else would have slept twentyfour hours with this sleeping potion it was only one hour for him  he then went with the two sons of scathach against the three sons of ilsuanach viz cuar and cett and cruife three warriors of aifes alone he met them all three and they fell by him there was a meeting in battle on the next morning and both hosts went until the two arrays were face to face then went the three sons of esse enchinde viz cire and bire and blaicne three other warriors of aife and began combat against the two sons of scathach they went on the path of feats scathach uttered a sigh at this for she knew not what would come of it first as there was no third man with her two sons against those three and then she was afraid of aife because she was the hardest womanwarrior in the world then cuchulaind went up to her two sons and sprang on the path and met them all three and they fell by him  aife challenged scathach to combat cuchulaind went up before aife and asked what it was she loved most scathach said: what she loves most said she is her two horses and her chariot and her charioteer cuchulaind and aife went on the path of feats and began combat there then aife shattered cuchulainds weapon so that his sword was no longer than his fist ah cried he the charioteer of aife and her two horses and her chariot have fallen down in the glen and have all perished at that aife looked up then cuchulaind approached her seized her at her two breasts took her on his back like a shoulderload and carried her with him to his own host then he threw her from him to the ground and placed his bare sword over him and aife said: life for life oh cuchulaind my three wishes to me said he thou shalt have them as they come with thy breath said she these are my three wishes said he thou to give hostage to scathach without ever afterwards opposing her thou to be with me this night before thy dun and to bear me a son i promise it all thus said she it was done in that wise  cuchulaind then went with aife and slept with her that night  p  then aife said she was with child and that she would bear a boy i shall send him this day seven year to erinn said she and do thou leave a name for him cuchulaind left a golden fingerring for him and said to her that he should go and seek him in erinn when the ring would fit on his finger and he said that conla was the name to be given to him and told her that he should not make himself known to anyone that he should not go out or the way of any man nor refuse combat to any man thereupon cuchulaind returned back again to his own people and came along the same road he met an old woman on the road who was blind of her left eye she asked him to beware and not be on the road before her he said there was no room for a footing for him save on the cliff of the sea which was beneath him she besought him to leave the road to her then he left the road except that his toes clung to it when she passed over him she hit his great toe to throw him off the path down the cliff he noticed it and leapt the heros salmonleap up again and struck the womans head off she was the mother of the three last warriors that had fallen by him viz esse enchinde and in order to destroy him had come to meet him  thereafter the hosts went with scathach to her own land and hostages were given to her by aife and cuchulaind stayed there for the day of his recovery  after the full lore of his soldierly arts with scathach had passed for cuchulaindas well as the applefeat the thunderfeat the bladefeat the foenfeat and the spearfeat the ropefeat the bodyfeat the cats feat the salmonfeat of a chariotchief the throw of the staff the jump over  the whirl of a brave chariotchief the spear of the bellows the boi of swiftness the wheelfeat the otharfeat the breathfeat the brud geme the heros whoop the blow  the counterblow running up a lance and righting the body on its point the scythechariot and the heros twisting round the  p  points of spearsthen came a message to him to return to his own land and he took leave then scathach told him what would befal him in the future and sang to him in the seers large shining ken and spake these words: welcome oh victorious warlike    then cuchulainn went in his ship to reach erinn this was the crew of the one ship viz lugaid and luan da mac loich and ferbaeth and larin and ferdiad and drust son of serb they went to the house of ruad king of the isles on samuin night there were there before them conall cernach and loegaire buadach levying the tribute for there was tribute at that time from the isles of the foreigners to the men of ulster  then cuchulaind heard a wailing  p  before him in the dun of the king what lament is that said cuchulaind the daughter of ruad is taken as tribute to the fomori said they it is therefore that the wailing is in the dun where is the maiden said he she is on the shore below said they cuchulaind went until he was near the maiden on the strand he asked tidings of her the maiden told him fully whence do the men come said he from that distant island yonder said she be not here in sight of the robbers he remained there awaiting them and killed the three fomori in single combat but the last man wounded him at the wrist the maiden gave him a strip from her garment round his wound he then went away without making himself known to the maiden the maiden came to the dun and told her father the whole story thereafter cuchulaind came to the dun like every other guest then conall and loegaire welcomed him many in the dun boasted of having killed the fomori but the maiden did not believe them a bath was then prepared by the king and each one was brought to her separately then cuchulaind came like everybody else and the maiden recognized him i shall give the maiden to thee said ruad and i shall pay her weddinggift myself not so said cuchulaind let her come this day year to erinn after me if it be pleasant to her and she will find me there  cuchulaind then came to emain and told his adventures there when he had cast his fatigue from him he set out for the rath of forgall to seek emer he was a whole year near it but could not approach her for the number of the watch he came then at the end of the year it is today oh laeg said cuchulaind we have our meeting with the daughter of ruad but we know not the exact place for we were not wise let us go said he to the border of the land  when they were on the shore of loch cuan they beheld two birds on the sea cuchulaind put a stone in his sling and aimed at the birds the men ran up to them after having hit one of the birds when they came up to them this is what they saw two women the most beautiful in the world these were derbforgaill the daughter of ruad and her handmaid evil is the deed thou hast done oh cuchulaind said she it was to meet thee we came though thou hast hurt us cuchulaind sucked the stone out  p  of her with its clot of blood round it i shall not wed thee now said cuchulaind for i have drunk thy blood but i shall give thee to my companion here viz to lugaid of the red stripes and it was done thus cuchulaind then wanted to go to the rath of forgall and the scythechariot was prepared for cuchulaind that day it was called scythechariot carpat serrda from the iron scythes that were from it or again because it was first invented by the serians  he then arrived at the rath of forgall and jumped the heros salmonleap across the three ramparts so that he was on the ground of the dun and he dealt three blows in the liss so that eight men fell from each blow and one man escaped in the midst of each group of nine viz scibur and ibur and cat three brothers of emer forgall then made a leap on to the rampart of the rath without in fleeing from cuchulaind and he fell and was without life cuchulaind took emer with him and her fostersister with their two loads of gold and silver and took a leap back again across the third rampart with the two maidens and went forth  cries were raised around them from every direction scennmend rushed against them cuchulaind killed her on the ford which is hence called the ford of scenmnend thence they came to glondath there cuchulaind killed hundred men of them great is the deed glond which thou hast done said emer to have killed hundred armed ablebodied men glondth shall be its name for ever said cuchulaind  he reached cru foit bloodturf its name was originally raebn white field until then he dealt great angry blows on the hosts in that place so that the streams of blood broke over it on each side the height is a turf of blood through thee today oh cuchulaind cried the maiden so hence it is called crfoit viz crft ie turf of blood the pursuers overtook them at ath nimfait on the boyne emer left the chariot cuchulaind made a chase on the shore so that the clods flew from the hoofs of the horses across the ford northward he made another chase northward so that the clods flew from the hoofs of the horses over the ford southward hence it is called ford of the two clods from the clods hither and thither  now cuchulaind killed one hundred on each ford from ath scennmend at ollbine to the boyne of bray and he fulfilled all the deeds that he had vowed to the maiden and he came safely out of it and reached emain macha towards the darkness of that night emer was brought into the  p  red branch to conchobor and to the men of ulster and they bade her welcome there was a grim eviltongued man of the men of ulster in the house viz bricriu of the venomous tongue the son of arba it was then he said: forsooth it will be disagreeable to cuchulaind what will happen tonight viz the woman whom he brought with him will sleep with conchobor for with him is the deflowering of virgins before the men of ulster ever cuchulaind grew mad when he heard that and shook himself so that the cushion burst which was under him and its feathers were flying about the house he went out then this is very hard said cathbad but it is an ordinance to the king to do everything that bricriu has said cuchulaind will slay him that will sleep with his wife let cuchulaind be called to us said conchobor to know if we can soothe his wrath then cuchulaind came arise said conchobar and bring me the herds that i have in slieve fuait then cuchulaind went and drove together whatever he found in slieve fuait of swine and stags and of every sort of fowl game besides and drove them in one drove with him to the meadow of emain then his wrath had departed from him  a council was held by the men of ulster about this affair this was the resolution they arrived at that emer was to sleep that night with conchobor and fergus and cathbad in one bed with them to watch over the honour of cuchulaind and the men of ulster should bless him if he accepted it he did accept it and it was done thus conchobor paid emers wedding gift on the morrow and cuchulainds honour price was paid and he slept then with his wife and they did not separate after that until they both died  then the chieftainry of the youths of ulster was given to cuchulaind these were the youths in emain at that time about whom the poet spoke setting forth their names:  the youths of emain the fairest host when they were in
