## Quantifying Change in Lady Gregory’s Rewritings of Irish Legends  
This repository contains the code used to analyze Lady Gregory’s adaptations of Irish legends using computational methods. The study explores how her retellings of Irish legends reframe mythological narratives to align with cultural nationalist ideals. Using computational methods, it uncovers her strategic modifications - such as the marginalization of Ulster and the elevation of gendered and nationalist themes - to foster a unified Irish identity. By blending literary analysis with digital humanities approaches, this study highlights Lady Gregory’s role in shaping Ireland’s mythological canon as both a literary and political project.
